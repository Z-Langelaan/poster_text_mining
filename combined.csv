One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.,positive;Movie
"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only ""has got all the polari"" but he has all the voices down pat too! You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning Orton and Halliwell and the sets (particularly of their flat with Halliwell's murals decorating every surface) are terribly well done.,positive";Movie
"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her ""sexy"" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.,positive";Movie
Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.,negative;Movie
"Petter Mattei's ""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.,positive";Movie
"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like ""dressed-up midgets"" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be ""up"" for this movie.,positive";Movie
I sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated Seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke were my hero's every week.You have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.We need a change of pace in TV and this would work for a world of under water adventure.Oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about TV and the many movies.So any ole way I believe I've got what I wanna say.Would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.If my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit,or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit,If this is so then I must go so lets do it.,positive;Movie
This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.<br /><br />It's truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn't still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still on the air.,negative;Movie
Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.,negative;Movie
If you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie. If you are young or old then you will love this movie, hell even my mom liked it.<br /><br />Great Camp!!!,positive;Movie
"Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.<br /><br />At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.<br /><br />Its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually I just lost interest.<br /><br />I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.<br /><br />For something similar but better try ""Brother from another planet"",negative";Movie
I saw this movie when I was about 12 when it came out. I recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. The horror. The horror.<br /><br />As a young kid going to these cheesy B films on Saturday afternoons, I still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. I didn't care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. I love them now for the unintentional humor.<br /><br />But, about a year or so later, I saw Psycho when it came out and I loved that the star, Janet Leigh, was bumped off early in the film. I sat up and took notice at that point. Since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well-worn formula. There are no rules.,negative;Movie
"So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of ""SPOILER"" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.,negative";Movie
The cast played Shakespeare.<br /><br />Shakespeare lost.<br /><br />I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses, but why ruin something so good.<br /><br />Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare? I do not know. What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler (hence bowdlerization) tried to do something similar in the Victorian era.<br /><br />In other words, you cannot improve perfection.<br /><br />I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text (and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie, as the saying goes, just does not cut it.,negative;Movie
This a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous. One of the actors is george clooney and I'm not a fan but this roll is not bad. Another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack (The man of constant sorrow). I recommand this movie to everybody. Greetings Bart,positive;Movie
Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....,negative;Movie
Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.,positive;Movie
This movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. Horrible. <br /><br />There wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another. There was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them) <br /><br />Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /><br />Examples<br /><br />>The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /><br />>The spider machine in the beginning was exactly like Frodo being attacked by the spider in Return of the Kings. (Elijah Wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????<br /><br />>And the whole machine vs. humans theme WAS the Matrix..or Terminator.....<br /><br />There are more examples but why waste the time? And will someone tell me what was with the Nazi's?!?! Nazi's???? <br /><br />There was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. The movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either. <br /><br />Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.,negative;Movie
I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.,positive;Movie
"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.,negative";Movie
After the success of Die Hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s, a glut of 'Die Hard on a .....' movies cashed in on the wrong guy, wrong place, wrong time concept. That is what they did with Cliffhanger, Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone's career.<br /><br />Cliffhanger is one big nit-pickers dream, especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing, base-jumping, aviation, facial expressions, acting skills. All in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk. Stallone even managed to get out-acted by a horse! However, if you an forget all the nonsense, it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills, and unintentionally, plenty of laughs.<br /><br />You've got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness, his tick every box band of baddies, and best of all, the permanently harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, Rex Linn as Travers.<br /><br />He may of been Henry in 'Portrait of a Serial Killer' but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe-worthy performance as Hal, he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors 'that man never hurt anybody' And whilst he surely can't be, it really does look like Ralph Waite's Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death.<br /><br />Mention too must go to former 'London's Burning' actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy, who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football, yes, you can't help enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good kicking.<br /><br />So forget your better judgement, who cares if 'that could never happen', lower your acting expectations, turn up the volume and enjoy! And if you're looking for Qaulen, he's the one wearing the helicopter.,positive;Movie
"I had the terrible misfortune of having to view this ""b-movie"" in it's entirety.<br /><br />All I have to say is--- save your time and money!!! This has got to be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn't even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! Because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie: the story is not interesting at all, all of the actors are paper-thin and not at all believable, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it's almost funny.......almost.<br /><br />The movie is just packed full of crappy one-liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are SO utterly unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end. They try to appear sexy in those weird, horrible costumes and they fail miserably!!!<br /><br />Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you some laughs, but this is just too painful to watch!!,negative";Movie
What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hrs to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him, I still liked it. The music by A.R.Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times, you really start liking it.,positive;Movie
"First of all, let's get a few things straight here: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). b) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.),negative";Movie
This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me. Nor does the development of the cop. It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br />,negative;Movie
The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.<br /><br />It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries,positive;Movie
"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But ""The Cell"" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to let you ""see"" what it's all about and not ""how"" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as ""weird"" or ""crazy"". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say ""Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs."" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4),positive";Movie
This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.,negative;Movie
"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.,negative";Movie
"'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.,positive";Movie
"Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely ""message"" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.,positive";Movie
"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.,positive";Movie
"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as ""Spider Baby"". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.,negative";Movie
"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ""ridiculous"". The first half of the film may be described as ""slow"" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.,positive";Movie
I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.,negative;Movie
"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' ""Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show""). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.,negative";Movie
The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.,negative;Movie
Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />It really IS only a movie as they say..,negative;Movie
Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in, week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!<br /><br />Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series!!!,positive;Movie
"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....,negative";Movie
"It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.,negative";Movie
"This movie is based on the book, ""A Many Splendored Thing"" by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a topic that comes from Han's personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances passé, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.,positive";Movie
"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. ""How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy""? Gary Busey is know for his ""B"" movies, but this is a sure ""W"" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is ""confused"" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.,negative";Movie
"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.,negative";Movie
This movie struck home for me. Being 29, I remember the '80's and my father working in a factory. I figured, if I worked hard too, if I had pride and never gave up I too could have the American Dream, the house, a few kids, a car all to call my own. I've noted however, without a degree in something (unlike my father that quit at ninth grade) and a keen sense of greed and laziness, you can't get anywhere.<br /><br />I would like to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. it's made for TV, and I just saw it an hour ago. Ic an't find it anywhere! I'd love to show this to my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think and remind them that once upon a time, Americans WOULD work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished!! I think the feeling is still there, but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas...,positive;Movie
As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical,positive;Movie
Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary.

"How this film could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really? What were the scriptwriters thinking? Was it just ignorance (""I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School"") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended?

Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.,positive;Movie
Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />The genre's well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though. Yellow clues wherever you look.<br /><br />3 out of 10 limping killers,negative;Movie
"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to!

"***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br />Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br />Jimmy's life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a ""Valentine Day"" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy!

Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones.<br /><br />Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.,positive;Movie
"I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me. Alot of familiar faces will keep you asking yourself ""where I have I seen them before?""

"The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W. Bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. It's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. They've clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create. Sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /><br />Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen. As sympathetic as Robespierres plight is, it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine.,negative";Movie
As someone has already mentioned on this board, it's very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pacing, patience, directorial 'distance,' a plausible premise, a narrative 'flow,' and REALLY believable acting (aka GREAT acting). <br /><br />Such is not the case with 'Love Machine'. It starts to show its faux hand about the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in. It's downhill from there.<br /><br />Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explains in the extras, he began wanting to do a REAL doc, couldn't get funding, and settled for a cheaper way of making his film.<br /><br />The premise -- people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website -- was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff -- a pushy 'host,' hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites -- all, I guess, to elicit a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue.,negative;Movie
The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10,negative;Movie
"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this ""Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do"" movie. Clunky dialogue like ""I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it"" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh! No cliche is left unturned.,negative";Movie
NO SPOILERS!!<br /><br />After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!,positive;Movie
"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.,positive";Movie
What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.,negative;Movie
"I've just watched Fingersmith, and I'm stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show.<br /><br />Not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied.<br /><br />The actors were adequate, but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. Once this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes tedious.<br /><br />And just in case anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film.<br /><br />The end scene is disappointing and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went ""Ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along!"", must have been out for the evening.<br /><br />Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it...,negative";Movie

"An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) gets pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own. Things go OK until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) become worse.<br /><br />I've seen both the silent version and sound version of ""Stella Dallas"". Neither one affected me much (and I cry easily) but they were well-made if dated. Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of ""Beaches"" to get this made. This (predictably) bombed. The story is laughable and dated by today's standards. Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) don't help in supporting roles. Flimsy and dull. Really--who thought this would work? See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead. I give this a 1.,negative";Movie
"DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical ""bloodbath"" that Fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those ""helping"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...<br /><br />DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classical"" giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10,positive";Movie
"Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC clad, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, the faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark.<br /><br />Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.<br /><br />In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this filmwhether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylumis hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it's this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of STV crap just about bearable.<br /><br />But be warned, even though the presence of semi-naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humour (as the DVD blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier.<br /><br />3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient.,negative";Movie
I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. It didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film. The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes, Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore. All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie. Thank you.,negative;Movie
"I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.,negative";Movie
"This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook ""How to write a space disaster movie"" and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereo-typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space - putting on a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done time and time again.<br /><br />Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster $50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a ""Special Visual Effects"" Emmy has me absolutely gob-smacked.<br /><br />I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects!<br /><br />And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I'm no NASA expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twenty-nine year old who has not been in the control room before.<br /><br />The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script.<br /><br />I give this film 2 out of 10, with the above-average work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.,negative";Movie
Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.,negative;Movie
"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some ""gore"" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's ""sequel"" to AFTERMATH (now available as a ""double feature"" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don't care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...,negative";Movie
I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like, when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />It captured Malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />All i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />It kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it. Not even to make out in the cinema. Ha ha.,positive;Movie
"I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's.

He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don't want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M.

Upon viewing Tobe Hooper's gem, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college/crocodile niche of the exploitation/monster genre. I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scripts, and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer, all we'd need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants.<br /><br />While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus referenced his own movies, Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions/homages?/rip-offs to Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000, and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock.<br /><br />I was disappointed the crock didn't get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism...or crocky appreciation, but the quasi-Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach. Perhaps, in the coming years, we'll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero-G monkey/midget/crocodile bloodshed.<br /><br />All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me.,negative;Movie
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.,positive;Movie
The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.<br /><br />That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.<br /><br />Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.<br /><br />Coburn's gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.<br /><br />The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is a lot. <br /><br />For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your film.,positive;Movie
"Maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the DVD, which is with the director as he keeps saying ""hi, kids"" into the camera like a buffoon), but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator. Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.<br /><br />In this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by ""A Murderer"" as he's credited. First off, the director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it's from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name I can't remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'Gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) You just want it to be done with, for the 'I hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.,negative";Movie
"The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass. What does that leave us with? One comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro's manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie.,negative";Movie
"This film took me by surprise. I make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler. All I knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that IMDb readers gave it a 7.8, Rotten Tomatoes users ranked it at 7.9 and the critics averaged an amazing 8.2! If anything, they UNDERRATED this little gem.<br /><br />Filmmaker Doug Block decided to record his parents ""for posterity"" and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents, outspoken mother Mina, and less than forthcoming dad, Mike. I immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker (Mike & Mina's son Doug) was going to take us. As a matter of fact, I doubt that Doug himself knew where he was going with this!<br /><br />Life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey. It is difficult to verbalize just how moved I was with this story and the unique way in which it was told. Absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must-see even if you aren't a fan of the documentary genre. This film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten. ""51 Birch Street"" is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you. The best news of all is that HBO had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience, eventually, millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work. BRAVO!!!!!!!!,positive";Movie
Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel dumb. But it's a great movie. Not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down. Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. Watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. Awesome. You won't be the same after you see it.,positive;Movie
The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? <br /><br />You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the acting TERRIBLE (don't even get me started about the southern accents *y'all*) and the story was trite. Just remember....you were warned!,negative;Movie
Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school play, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.,negative;Movie
"""Fate"" leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled ""The Number 23"" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10,negative";Movie
We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable, and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.<br /><br />Just terrible,negative;Movie
This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!! The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.,negative;Movie
"This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. I wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end. If you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert's character, Ophelia, is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. Brad Johnson, also an excellent actor, is Matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. He is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter, Pip, and initially, Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. Two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. I wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment, and I got it with this. In regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. ""A Secret Affair"" with Janine Turner is far superior (not a Steele book), as are some of Steele's earlier books turned into film.,negative";Movie
Oh noes one of these attack of the Japanese ghost girl movies... i don't even remember how many i've seen. maybe it sells... but not to me. not scary at all. the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these... also the pulling of the kid. i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies. cellphone scene is also nothing new... the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked... i mean it lacked all dramaticness... OK this is for kids 14-16 who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique... we'll let me tell you. there's a million of you =D this is one of them. 3/10 i've seen worse but you won't be missing anything by NOT seeing this!,negative;Movie
"Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town Reverand who's married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of ""Misery"" type of way. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. Technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase,negative";Movie
"Hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world. It only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over again. Take superheroes for example, for each X-Man and Spiderman, there are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remakes are even worst. It only took The Ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), to bring a ton of look-alike creepy-woman based horrors, e.g. The Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was fine, but pointless), and the grudges.<br /><br />The first Grudge wasn't entirely bad. It was scary most of the way, which is what one could expect from it. Plus, the plot had some brains mixing narratives. Grudge 2 is exactly like the previous; this could be a good thing, but hey, what boy Men in Black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain? For the Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />Tired scares, bad acting (except for Amber Tamblyn), and clichés all over the place. Three stories take place, on different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place; and finally, an American family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door. Glad to say (and I mean it) that everything is tied up at the end, but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture, when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />The chills are all over there, a girl alone in the lockers, someone who shouldn't enter a house, others that dig too deep. Meanwhile, ghosts keep killing and killing and killing, which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't that seem just like another bad Japanese remake, something called Pulse? Yeah, day after day it's getting easier to hold a grudge... against Hollywood bullshits.,negative";Movie
"""Down Periscope"" has been in our library since it first arrived in VHS. Since then, we have acquired the DVD and a digital from Cinema Now.<br /><br />It is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con. It is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters, I am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered.<br /><br />The movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession, even among the very young. I became aware of this while visiting the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama in 2002. A group of Cub Scouts, my grandson among them, had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board.<br /><br />It is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our Navy and Hollywood... which is rare company.<br /><br />Thanks to Kelsey Grammar, Lauren Holly and Rob Schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie, such great entertainment!,positive";Movie

I'll give the creators of this film ONE positive comment about their 'creation': Thanks for removing the REC XX/XX/XX from the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. I can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie.<br /><br />And for the record, I *saw* the movie, but did not watch it.

"Deanna Durbin, Nan Grey and Barbara Read are ""Three Smart Girls"" in this Universal film from 1936, which introduces Deanna Durbin to film audiences. It also stars Ray Milland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winninger, John King, Binnie Barnes and Alice Brady. It's a sweet story about three young women, now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (Winninger) is marrying again. Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. Realizing that the intended, called ""Precious"" (Barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (Brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy Count. This is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The man he chooses is a full-time drunk (Auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (Milland). What a mess.<br /><br />This is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by Auer, Milland, Barnes and Brady. The young women are pretty and all do good work. The emphasis, of course, is on young Durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. In fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. She sings a delightful ""Il Bacio"" in a police station.<br /><br />One of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by Charles Winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. Barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. In fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.<br /><br />Universal gives Durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. Ray Milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.<br /><br />Very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for Deanna.,positive";Movie
If anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to, with conversation, character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new, better and different, those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing, directing, and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in Italy and England. Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye. Reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century, this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character, and the viewer, too. An artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us.,positive;Movie
"I watched this series out of curiosity,wanting to see if they could possibly and with ALL this modern technology,out do Cecil B. DeMille's classic epic of 1956, starring Charleton Heston,Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was let down. Yes, they had all the Biblical characters correct, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, that held your interest throughout the first movie. If you going to have a mini-series, you have to have some ""rivoting"" scenes, the ""Burning bush"", Parting the ""RED Sea"",drowning ""Pharohs Armies"", ""building Sethi's Pyramids"", could have been done with todays' technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as ""Lord of the Rings"" or the Matrix. Obviously, they didn't want to leave a LASTING impression of ""faith and sacrifice"", which is much needed in these trouble times.,negative";Movie
"Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View, passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father, an impudent, violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother, but each is seperate, and utterly unique. He changes completely, with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything.<br /><br />As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character, and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human.<br /><br />This movie, despite small scene-transition faults and the like, is an inspiration. Yes, it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. ""I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated."" ""Wheel out the cripple!"" And his performance never slows down, never falters, and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again, and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes, twitching and guttural speeches.<br /><br />A must-see. Fo sho, yo!,positive";Movie
My guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise how can one explain its confused, abbreviated storyline. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation. The movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot.<br /><br />If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it still wouldn't be much good. The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist. So it's got a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't do anything useful with them.<br /><br />Bad dialog, cardboard characters, and one interesting scene involving Hercules and his three antagonistic sons. Not unwatchable but also not worth watching.,negative;Movie
"Well, I like to watch bad horror B-Movies, cause I think it's interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie.

I like Ed Wood's movies cause it's so inept it's very funny. But people!!! ""The Chilling"" is not funny and is not even ""interesting"". It's EXTREMELY BORING horror movie without ANYTHING what makes even bad movies watchable. There's no acting, no screenplay, no direction, no thrills and not even blood.

I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember, I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid, this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it, while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins much like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach's castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma's home, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station's Power Stars and scattered them across the universe, it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are big, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls, all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same, but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game, and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks, you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to, and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!,positive;Movie
This short film that inspired the soon-to-be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers. The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job, joins in the fight against the evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning, but is barely present for the remainder of the feature. This film's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd-ball comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately not much else lies below it. The plot that is set up doesn't really have time to show. But it's surely follows it plot better than many high-budget Hollywood films. This film is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is, and don't expect a deep story.,positive;Movie
"Okay, last night, August 18th, 2004, I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble at a showing of the film The Manson Family at the Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam movie I've ever seen. Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting ""f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!""<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, ""You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family."" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!? This is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard! The film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock 'n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small, dimly lit theatre, and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock 'n roll mind of a man who couldn't even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on screen. This film accomplishes little more than warping the public's image of actual events (which helped shape the state of America and much of the world today) into some sort of Slasher/Comic Book/Porno/Rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual.<br /><br />The film was definitely very impressive to look at. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of Charlie's work with the Family off of his Lie album. The editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at Mtv than to the Underground Film Festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers. I felt like I was at a midnight Rocky Horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled some sort of stoned Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying. The descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy, throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow, lethargic, and chubby representation that was actually presented.<br /><br />All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, ""You can write a bunch of bullsh** books or make a bunch of bullsh** movies...etc. etc."" Case in point. Even the disclaimer ""Based on a True Story"" is a dead giveaway, signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead.<br /><br />All I can say is this, when the film ended I got a free beer so I'm glad I went, but not so glad I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f*** up for asking the director a question.

I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart. I am glad I did. It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie/game remake. The bonus levels were very hard! The sniper one I think was too hard, it made me so frustrated I didn't play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it. <br /><br />The only thing I might change was the upgrade system. I didn't notice any difference from un-upgraded equipment to the upgraded, such as buying an armor upgrade didn't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.,positive;Movie
"No, this hilariously horrible 70's made-for-TV horror clinker isn't about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake. Still, this exceptionally awful, yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute, unremitting silliness and atrociousness that's quite tasty in a so-execrable-it's-downright-awesome sort of way. Richard Crenna, looking haggard and possibly inebriated, and Yvette Mimieux, who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in ""Jackson County Jail,"" sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint, dull, sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute German Shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit. Pretty soon Mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann (the psychic alien moppets from the Disney ""Witch Mountain"" pictures) are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty, ugly canine entity in the den. Boy, now doesn't that sound really scary and disturbing? Well, scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain't, but it sure is funny, thanks to Curtis (""Night Tide"") Harrington's hopelessly weak direction, cartoonish (not so) special effects, an almost painfully risible'n'ridiculous plot, and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story (besides the leads, both Martine Beswicke and R.G. Armstrong briefly pop up as members of a Satanic cult and Victor Jory has a nice cameo as a helpful Native American shaman). Favorite scene: the malicious Mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on Crenna, practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade. While stuck-up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock, devout TV trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to Alpo.,positive";Movie
It is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen, and who will die. It is about 4 women and a man who on a vacation. This was made during the end of the ultra Nazi seventies, when blonde women were supposedly ultra American survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death.<br /><br />This movie, like the others of that era, contrives to bring this about, and the viewer knows this. There is no mystery or suspense. The people squabble, but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time, it is laughable.<br /><br />The five people happen upon two savage young characters, and go nuts. Everyone is nuts, so that the director-writer team can justify their Nazi propaganda.<br /><br />For some reason, the guy is attracted to the blonde, who is really not much to look at, and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over. One must remember that in the seventies, movies were meant to appeal to women and not men.<br /><br />Totally crap and totally depressing.,negative;Movie
"Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy ""Show People"" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hick from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jalopy they arrive in is a hoot - as is Davies outrageous southern costume. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow slapstick star William Haines, who is immediately smitten with her. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio (""High Art Studios"") and lands a job in stuffy period pieces. A handsome but fake actor (Andre Telefair) shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course learns that is not who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful throughout, as she - outrageously - runs the gamut of emotions required of a ""serious"" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comedic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. This is a silent film with a few ""sound effects"" as sound pictures were just coming into their own. A treasure of a film.,positive";Movie
"The performance of every actor and actress (in the film) are excellently NATURAL which is what movie acting should be; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors' and director, Attenborough's credits that puzzles me: aren't they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent, long lasting film for the audience?

"While Star Trek the Motion Picture was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is plain bad. In this terrible sequel, the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the Federation that ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus and Kronos (the Klingon home world) have been kidnapped by a renegade Vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier. There, he hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he persuades many of the senior officers of the Enterprise to betray Kirk and get a hold of the ship. They do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god-like alien. This one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin. At the core is a good idea that is never really developed. The plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before. It is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. The action scenes don't have the suspense of Wrath of Kahn, the philosophy is boring, and the humor is stale. Now I will focus most of my anger on William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego gets bigger. Most of the focus is on him, Spock, and McCoy, but does not give the others enough to do. Moreover, whereas Shatner is usually guilty of over-acting in previous movies and television spots, he is just plain bad in this one. Now Kirk is reckless, a practical jokers, and silly. One of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song, ""Row Row Row your Boat"" in a round by a campfire. In any case, this is the worst of the Star Trek franchise. I should have given it three out of ten instead of five.,negative";Movie
"Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with ""Citizen Kane"": It's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of ""Kane"" are evident. Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There's also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. For all that, I was quite fascinated.,positive";Movie
"This is the best version (so far) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work. Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared ""not handsome"". But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark, pretty as she is, is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre. This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it. Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and have read and re-read the original. The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this.,positive";Movie
"Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called ""movie."" They described ""blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence."" I saw no ""intrigue.""

At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with ""impervious"" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the ""plot."" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable.

I liked Boyle's performance, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite. I stopped watching after the scene where Lonnrot is questioning the guy from the Yidische Zaitung, or thereabouts. I wasted $4 renting this, but at least I can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake.,negative;Movie

"The Assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character, rather than star turns, the need to stage special effects, obligatory romance, and endless car chases. However, there is a car chase in here, and a dandy it is. Aidan Quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer ""recruited"" to eliminate him. It is rare that a second or third tier actor, such as Quinn, is given an important starring role like this that carries a film. Usually, such a role is given to an A-list actor with box office draw, which is probably why I never heard of this film before I saw it. Donald Sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous, somewhat creepy at times, agent that recruits Quinn. Ben Kingsley is fine also as the Israeli agent. The plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines, which converge in gradual fashion toward the end, and not all at once as we're used to seeing. The paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity. The locations are convincing and effective. The soundtrack is nothing special, but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days, without dumb and/or meaningless plot developments; unconvincing star turns; loud, annoying, music video type soundtracks; a villain that hams it up; and repeatedly a cast, costumes, and plot that cater mostly to an audience under 25. This is an outstanding thriller, which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release. ***1/2 of 4 stars.,positive";Movie

"Set in the 1794, the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton (Gerard Depardieu, at his finest) and Robespierre (a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak). The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to ""The Reign Of Terror"" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting. But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland. His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union, which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. His previous film ""Man Of Iron"" (1981) had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski, and that between Danton and Robespierre. Danton/Walesa are the voice of reason opposed to Robespierre/Jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. The film is based on the Polish play ""The Danton Affair"" written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. But what the film does is to concentrate on the behind-the-scenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris.,positive";Movie
Usually I'm a bit of a fan of the bad eighties & early nineties film featuring now has beens...but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through. Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert was not much better.

I have now seen quite a few films by Pedro Almodóvar, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comedic edge to this movie, I certainly couldn't find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie.,negative;Movie
I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood's novel 'The Robber Bride', and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version. A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder, and his buddy, an ex-cop journalist, tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends. It's fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms. Atwood's clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men, victims of scheming women...<br /><br />Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie. Zenia's manipulations aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed up. Roz, Charis, and Toni tell their stories -- to a man. Because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them.<br /><br />I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story. I normally do not look for feminist angles on media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as is. If I hadn't read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop, and you want to read more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot. It's the same plot: the movie excavated it, ironed it, and sprinkled it with male angst. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.,negative;Movie

"Ingrid Bergman, playing dentist Walter Matthau's faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss, is absolutely wonderful in this film. She handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and Goldie Hawn talk in a record booth (Ingrid's monologue is a front, but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart). Matthau is an odd choice for the leading man (he's too old for Goldie Hawn and too unrefined for Bergman, not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist), but I liked the way he tries hard to please Goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie. Hawn (who won a Supporting Oscar) is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today. This bedroom farce isn't terribly sophisticated (and faintly reminds one of ""Any Wednesday"" besides), but it's a welcome relief from the noisy, teen-oriented comedies they turn out today. ""Cactus Flower"" is a lovely sigh! *** from ****,positive";Movie

Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . At the time I couldn`t believe how movies like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up .

"This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces (""The Fall of the House of Usher"", ""Dance of Death"" (poem) ) is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house (for example, ""The Cat and the Canary"", ""The Old Dark House"", ""Night of Terror"" and so on). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of life-size dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film (or does he ? ) and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences.

"""Revolt of the Zombies"" proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn't necessarily make lightning strike twice.<br /><br />The Halperin brothers, responsible for the horror classic ""White Zombie"", made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close-ups of Lugosi's eyes from that previous film. There was a court battle with the ""White Zombie"" film's rights owners, who didn't want the Halperins to be able to use the word 'zombie' in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad films can make much more money simply by having the word 'Zombie' appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting. It seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle. The zombies here seem not to be true walking dead, but simply hypnotism victims.<br /><br />Wanna create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Be ready to crack a few eggs, including your own.<br /><br />THE LAME PLOT: Man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend, whom she loves, jealous. This sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind-control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spit.<br /><br />This includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments I've ever seen. You'd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting isn't even good. This movie makes the racially insensitive ""King of the Zombies"" (which appeared on the same double bill DVD I bought) seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic. It makes the atomic age sci-fi alien zombie cheese fest ""Invisible Invaders"" seem like a serious drama. This is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a Korean film fan twitch (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits list the ironically named company Favorite Films. I'm not sure whose favorite film this would be, but they're obviously an idiot.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of: zombies, romance, or classic films.,negative";Movie
The complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.,negative;Movie
This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don't really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny.,positive;Movie

Two hours ago I was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography. It is quite understandable how it won the prize of Best Camera in Cannes 2000. Close ups predominated it. Close ups of walls, humans and of many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually by the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time. Each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie. Silence and slow movements characterize the movie. Some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close-ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes. The story was also connected somehow with the history of Hong Kong and the region the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end. In short I would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema.,positive;Movie
"Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.<br /><br />The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. Morty, or ""Micky"" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.<br /><br />The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it's up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, ""you must be the short depressed kid we ordered."" Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, ""you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in."" But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.<br /><br />The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but ""it just doesn't matter"". This is a pretty good film on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. Murray will keep you laughing throughout. Just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!!

When he loses the assistant in the movie, he's helpless and can't get into any computers. HE'S A HACKER!

These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies, they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species.<br /><br />This should be banned and destroyed. I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market!!<br /><br />This movie should be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.,negative;Movie
"Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt, and Corey Feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something I'd love to try sometime. Where to begin: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, ""action"" in places. This is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed-up has-been and never-was's love to star in. I actually felt embarrassed for the ""stars"" in this ""film"". The only thespian missing to top this turd was Gary Coleman, who if he would have been in the movie, would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad, rather than just plain bad.<br /><br />There was one part in the film where Carol Alt screamed, ""DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?!?"" Yes, Carol, I do, your agent does, and PLEASE for the love of all that is decent and holy... GO AWAY and stop degrading yourself like this! This film is something Anna Nicole Smith would take part in.<br /><br />I would tell you what the plot was, but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article, plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway, so I barely paid attention.,negative";Movie
"This film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or Ms. English tried). Assembling talented actors together with a successful & experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.<br /><br />I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors & the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English get the changes & updates or subtleties right. If only she (as writer, director AND producer) had reached out for some assistance, I think it could have been good. But it was not.<br /><br />It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time & money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie execs are having a meeting & the caption reads: ""Let's remake a classic with worse everything!"",negative";Movie
"I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and the cousin of these women, would encourage the Maysles' to make ""Big Edie"" and ""Little Edie"" the subject of a film. They certainly could be considered the ""skeletons"" in the family closet. The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women. I'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating. (i.e. ""Are they nuts? Or am I missing something?""). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix does not have it. Facets does, though.,positive";Movie
"C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />This use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />Except a few notable exceptions i.e ""The city on the edge of forever"" , ""assignment Earth"" and ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a LOT of rubbish! He doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view. They used wobbly plywood for the floor, cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels. You can clearly see the folds in the paper ! Every expense spared or what !,negative";Movie
"I just watched this movie on it's premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I liked (not loved) ""Mork & Mindy"" as a kid, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic performance. This movie made me remember why. Was the original show great? Not really, but Robin certainly was. Which brings me to this movie.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised, expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show (which in a way it was). But, of course, the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from struggling street jester to national t.v star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife. And my hat is off to star Chris Diamantopoulos as he portrayed Mr. Williams with integrity, sensitivity, and heart; not just a cute impression, although it was even dead-on. (On an unrelated note, I noticed that Robin's struggles were in some ways similar to Andy Kaufman, who was under-appreciated by network t.v. and held back creatively, but that's the ""Taxi"" behind the scenes biopic.)<br /><br />All in all, this was a very enjoyable flick, in which I felt I got to know a little more of the man behind the Orkan. The acting was solid by all- never melodramatic like I suspected- and the story moved along well. Performances that were particularly good were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi heckles Robin was a hoot!). Not a great masterpiece by any means (I would have liked to have seen a tad more about Pam Dawber), but definitely watchable, especially for those Robin Williams and ""Mork & Mindy"" fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!,positive";Movie
"I caught this film on AZN on cable. It sounded like it would be a good film, a Japanese ""Green Card"". I can't say I've ever disliked an Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean, and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I an not adverse to a light hearted films, like Tampopo or Chung King Express (two of my favourites), so I thought I would like this. Well, I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious, badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude, because no one in this film had a personality. And when any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumbling a line or two, their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before...the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki.. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy, because I didn't laugh once. Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this ""a refreshing breath of comedy"". It was neither refreshing, nor a breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting. I actually think that ""Spike of Bensonhurst"" is a better acted film than this...and I walked out half way through that film!,negative";Movie
"Before I begin, let me get something off my chest: I'm a huge fan of John Eyres' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-grade cross of both THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a cinematic genius, but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit (& spawned two sequels & a spin off).<br /><br />Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row following his capture after the so-called ""Bloody Shootout"" (which seems like a poor name for a killing spree  Meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store), being led to the electric chair. There is an amusing scene where Meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love (who was killed during the shootout), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her  Michael Silvano, a washed-up football star who spends his days watching his son Alex practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls ""a hamburger without the fries""), whose sole aim is to get his revenge, which basically means making Silvano's life a misery.<br /><br />Let me point out the fact that Judge and Jury is not a true horror film. It is a supernatural action film, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change form (which amounts to David Keith dressing up as everything from an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with an accent as bad as his moustache), a drag queen, a clown & a stand-up comedian), a shotgun which fires explosive rounds & an invulnerability to death (although that doesn't stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a Desert Eagle), to pay Silvano back for killing Meeker's wife.<br /><br />Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterisations, instead focusing solely on action scenes, which the film has plenty of. But that is the film's main flaw, since there's nothing to connect the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good, with Keith delivering the best performance, supported ably by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the washed-up cop quite well. Kelly Perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse.,negative";Movie
"Ye Lou's film Purple Butterfly pits a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces in war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. The sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. Normally I don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. I also agree with the viewer from Georgia that this film ""has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography"", but I don't think that helps the movie. The backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th Century, and I don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a Michael Bay film. The overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.<br /><br />The actors are all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. However, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in The Terminator.<br /><br />All in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of Suzhou He. 2/10,negative";Movie
After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for all of my life, I'm now 37, but never having read the book, I am totally confused as to what I've just seen.<br /><br />I am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel, as i'm sure most are, but only through hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.<br /><br />On the plus side...<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.<br /><br />Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...<br /><br />There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about (Eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.<br /><br />Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn't he on the front line? Why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he's drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak & ill? Why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? What's the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.<br /><br />The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same.<br /><br />Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.<br /><br />I personally can't abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.<br /><br />There's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.<br /><br />I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this.<br /><br />All in all, very disappointed in something I've waited for years to watch.,negative;Movie

"I just got back from this free screening, and this ""Osama Witch Project"" is the hands-down worst film I've seen this year, worse than even ""Catwoman"" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.<br /><br />In ""September Tapes,"" a ""film crew"" of ""documentary journalists"" heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />They ""made"" eight tapes on their journey, which now ""document"" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a ""documentary."")<br /><br />The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching ""MacGyver"" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. I don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said ""Shoot me.""<br /><br />The crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom. <br /><br />You wish they'd brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons.<br /><br />Around ""Tape 4,"" I began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew.,negative";Movie
I remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years-old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it (climbing the furniture, jumping around making monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but oddly enough a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (keep in mind that I saw Highlander very shortly after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that film, until about a month ago. It happened to be on cable as I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and I had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed up to watch this movie that I loved as a kid. <br /><br />Upon viewing it I realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was dubbed by someone else. Ian Holme was of course solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up, but what was most surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was great! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark, were just amazing.<br /><br />As I stated earlier I am Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again.<br /><br />So to make a short story way too long, I was a little disappointed that the film was not that good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I do not regret staying up until 6:00am to see it.,positive;Movie
A family is traveling through the mid West. There's widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town named Hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely. Their car breaks down and they're forced to stay. They soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil.<br /><br />The story is not that good. People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end. Also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end. The acting is pretty poor too. Bateman and Capri are bland and everybody else is about the same. Only old pros Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones give good performances. Still this movie does work. It forgoes blood and gore (there's some but this is PG) and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere. The acting hampers a lot of it but it still works. Martin especially chews the scenery in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (sort of) like this movie but it did work on me. It's a quiet kind of horror that isn't made anymore. Hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.,positive;Movie
"Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband--and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late; she's also recently learned she's pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she doesn't want to be a complacent wifey, despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone). She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life. The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the very talented Wilmer Butler) are astutely realized, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms. Some scenes (such as Knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we've been made privy to. He allows scenes to play out, yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very frisky moments). It's a heady endeavor--so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later. Some may shun Coppola's unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony, however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings. *** from ****,positive";Movie
This movie was not very well directed. they almost totally disregarded the book.I guess they were trying 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was cute. Some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book. Major parts of the book were once again chopped out.You lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely. Also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary. Also i was surprised ( not pleasantly) by a new character that was no where in the book.One of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book. Over all disappointing.,negative;Movie
"The buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Sadly, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the silly set, and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there's nothing else there to show.<br /><br />Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film. I don't really think they exist. I think they bought this script at ""Scripts-R-Us"", where you buy a standard blank ""Monster Movie"" script and just fill in the blanks. There's a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They actually ""let's split up"" in this movie). Hit Alien/Giant-bug/Monster/Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Huge-rabbit/Shark/Invisible-man in unsurvivable fire. Not dead yet. You know, the standard stuff. Even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled badly. <br /><br />What is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie. They psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, treating an invisible subject, and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been far more interesting. Had there been any desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stunk.<br /><br />I would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie, but I don't want to do any spoilers.

"A young girl becomes a war-time marine's pen-pal, and when he visits at war's end expecting someone a bit more ""available,"" comic complications ensue. All ultimately works out well, naturally, but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery. Errol Flynn's dead-on impression of Humphrey Bogart from ""Casablanca"" is a highlight, as are various send-ups of his own swashbuckling image (the ""jumping"" scene in the kitchen with Forrest Tucker is a riot). It is Tucker, though, who ""tucks"" the movie under his arm, lowers his head and barrels over the goal line. He demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in ""F-Troop"" and imparts a liveliness and energy that Flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance. Eleanor Parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued, and little Patti Brady charms as Tucker's actual pen-pal friend. A fine, lightweight ""coming home"" comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining.,positive";Movie
This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. <br /><br />Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful, though it couldn't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. <br /><br />All said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family.,negative;Movie
"Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book ""McCabe"" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. Aside from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here don't merit much interest, and the picture looks (intentionally) brackish and unappealing. Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds. It's a self-defeating picture, and yet, in an Altman-quirky way, it wears defeat proudly. ** from ****,negative";Movie
"What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me, on second viewing, a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.<br /><br />Spoiler of sorts follows.<br /><br />Poor Cedric; he apparently didn't know what hit him. Poor audience; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.<br /><br />On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this film. Subtitles were totally unnecessary, even though my French is ""presque rien."" I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. This was a polished, very professionally made motion picture. Though many scenes seem superfluous, I rate it nine out of ten.,positive";Movie

In the standard view, this is a purely awful movie. However, it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale.

"From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.<br /><br />Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.<br /><br />The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.<br /><br />It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.<br /><br />Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.,negative";Movie
"I've always enjoyed films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. ""A River Runs Through It"" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has it's rough spots, but it is a wonderful trip.<br /><br />Robert Redford brings a lot to the film. His narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly. As a director, he is restrained and calm, and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes. As for the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprising well as brothers. I don't know quite how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they truly feel real. ""A River Runs Through It"" is a wonderful film.<br /><br />8.6 out of 10,positive";Movie
The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. The main problem is with the castings, that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not in their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.,negative;Movie
"This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece,even though it got good actors , great script and rather good photograph was not a so called ""blockbuster"" movie in my Country. The movie itself is very powerful,it's about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home-village after been released from a 5yo prison time(drugs) The end is rather sad.... Mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well... Lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency... 7 out of 10 because very few Greek movies can make such an impression!,positive";Movie
MYSTERY MEN has got to be THE stupidest film I've ever seen, but what a film! I thought it was fabulous, excellent and impressive.

You know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of Listerine or whatever it is and he's trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink? That's a great metaphor for this movie. I kept watching, even though it was really difficult. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit it out when I had the chance.<br /><br />The premise is corny enough to be fun. For the first time in like a thousand years, Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead. It's up to Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the Gargoyles run amok. Unfortunately, the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads. The best acting is done by the CG Gargoyles.<br /><br />In the end, this movie feels like a poor man's Van Helsing. If you check your brain at the door, this might get you through a dreary Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.,negative;Movie

"This is one of a rarity of movies, where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka. To be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film.<br /><br />The cinematic aspect of Wolfgang Something's photography seems to have left out both close-ups and breasts. Mo and Wolfgang's collaborative effort revealed the passion of the two actresses, plastic peens holding passion. There's also beetle banging. As Violet would have put it: ""This (plastic peen) goes up your butt"". The rat porn and subsequent rat smashing is awesome. <br /><br />Alright. So if you are still reading, let us explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students, who, finishing a film class with her, decided to get poop- faced and watch here directorial debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much that's been hammered into our skulls. So this movie is quite the experience. At the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie. <br /><br />About 13 minutes into this game, none of us could see straight. The sheer amount of Dido's in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant.There was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a Kurt Cobain lookalike with absolutely no context, save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh-so-naturally reading a local newspaper. Because that's what we all do. The heart-shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of Lolita. And something about that provocative scene of the nude chin-up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we were kidding.<br /><br />Enough intellectual contemplation. ON TO THE DRINKING GAME! This will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one. It's very simple, and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care.<br /><br />The Mo Ogrodnik/Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Every time you see anything related to pornography, take a drink. 2. Every time you see auteur Mo Ogrodnik's name appear, take a drink. 3. Sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Any time somebody points a gun at another character, take a drink. -At this point you will probably need to refill/pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body.- 6. Any time there is blood (INCLUDING ""LADY BLOOD""), please take a sip! 7. The underused hula-hoop girl requires one drink per second. 8. Gratuitous use of the ""magic black man"" requires one drink. 9. If you can't figure out the through-line, KEEP DRINKING, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you are able to predict a line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /><br />That's it, internet! Keep drinking, and try not to get riped.<br /><br />-Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.,negative";Movie
Even though I'm quite young, The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can remember.<br /><br />It's the sort of film that is worth trying the once. I can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV. I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film, it didn't much details except something like, 'John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up, Jared Harris Stars'. I'd never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />The film had a slow start but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters. As a huge fan, I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like. The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent. THe make-up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A *SPOILER*:<br /><br />As I mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. As for Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it.<br /><br />It is quite different from the other biographical films I've seen where it's about how The Beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. E.g. 'Backbeat'.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would say, if you're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. At only about 95 minutes long, it's worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film, I'd be very interested.,positive;Movie

"This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. Along with other such nasty films as ""The Burning Bed,"" ""Enough,"" or ""Monster,"" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? Answer: Hell no.<br /><br />Imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. Were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She's a criminal who belongs in prison, and deserves our derision and contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.,negative";Movie
The premise of this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting, it was just bland and dull.<br /><br />SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death, it was accidental, so although it was a murder it wasn't like the guy set out to do it. Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister, and hearing her message. It was dull and boring.<br /><br />With some polishing, and better acting it could have been pretty good.,negative;Movie
The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy, quaint streets and sunshine. I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere, but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere.<br /><br />Othello works for big, fat Mr. Karva, his crime-boss step-dad (at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it's never really defined, but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers, so trust me, he's a prick) doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand-jobs. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black dude who is always dashing from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running. Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello's flat, where he promptly starts granting more wishes. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva has the boy kidnapped. But he isn't sure of what would really bring him happiness. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand-job? Either way, I don't want to see the little boy grant him the second.<br /><br />It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there's hardly any back-story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Grisoni, a favourite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy. Who's origins are never revealed. That's just plain irritating! <br /><br />Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score, this film has little to recommend.,negative;Movie
"I can't emphasize it enough, do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter, you'd best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right, perhaps I'm overexaggerating a little. This isn't the worst kids' movie... no, let me rephrase that. This isn't the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be ""Jack"", which I've been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adults won't learn anything surprising (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I degress).<br /><br />I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There's a better movie, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the adults will like it too!<br /><br />By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind, if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.,negative";Movie

"The Elegant Documentary -<br /><br />Don't watch this movie ... if you're an egotistical know-all student of physics. This much less than one percent (miniscule fraction) of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know.<br /><br />Do watch this movie! - If you're one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than 99% of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including Relativity, Quantum, String and M-theory.<br /><br />What a brilliantly architected documentary. Starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a Universe of pure magic - and dimensions beyond. I have always had a huge appreciation of Mathematics. This movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you're about to fail the grade.<br /><br />The show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini-series split over three shows. It therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented. I found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence.<br /><br />We are all (and everything around us) is vibrational-energy with a natural tendency towards harmony. This movie may blow your mind - or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us (even with the Hubble Telescope) and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high-school. M-theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of 'possibility'.<br /><br />It just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it's very nature move (by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting) out of the realm of Science and into the realm of Philisophy.<br /><br />You do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to God.<br /><br />Bravo Brian Greene. Well done indeed.<br /><br />P.S. If you're interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the Universe and would like some more insight into the 'possibilities' Quantum mechanics blended with Spirituality (of all things) can bring then I highly recommend that you also watch ""What the Bleep!? - Down the Rabbit Hole"". Yes I know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a Shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn't seen one before (my eyes process light reflections just fine - I see things everyday that I've never seen before) and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don't divide. But if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don't like and hang on to those that you do - there is a lot to like about this film.<br /><br />Then watch ""The Secret"" (2006 documentary about The Law of Attraction - search for IMDb title ""tt0846789""). This information just might change your life profoundly - forever. If you search deeper you might even find the Universe is talking to us with thought (if you'll listen) - and some are - and that is truly incredible. There is a modern day Jesus/Mohammad/Buddha (those, among others, that history suggests have communicated with the non-physical) alive today and she lives in Texas. I know some of you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but I have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the Universe as I do now.,positive";Movie
"In 1993, with the success of the first season of Batman: The Animated Series, Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit-show with producing a feature-length movie, originally slated for Direct-To-Video, but bumped up to theatrical status. It would become known as Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. Ten years after Phantasm, we have had an additional three feature-films released from the boys at the WB, Sub-Zero, Return of the Joker, and now, Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.<br /><br />The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm: A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin. Now, Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.<br /><br />The animation is the sleeker, futuristic style that was utilized for Batman: The Animated Series' fifth and sixth seasons (AKA The New Batman Adventures). , it's quite nicely done, and just as sleek as Return of the Joker's animation. There is also some use of CGI, but it's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub-Zero. The music was alright. Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score, although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans' rodent-shaped hearts.<br /><br />Kevin Conroy, as always, does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's also great to have the old Batman: The Animated Series alumni back; that includes Bob Hastings (Commissioner Gordon), Robert Costanzo (Detective Bullock), Tara Strong (Barbara Gordon/Batgirl; her cameo hints at the romantic-relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond), and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).<br /><br />Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne, the old mob boss from the original series, appears for the first time since the fourth season.<br /><br />Overall, while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago, MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films. And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan, you will love the five-minute short Chase Me.,positive";Movie
"I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).<br /><br />Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too.<br /><br />The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the ""Blair Which"", sure enough, there's an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film, there's no other explanation than: ""Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!!"" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise.<br /><br />Than finally, there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock...<br /><br />My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances.,negative";Movie
"Why can't a movie be rated a zero? Or even a negative number? Some movies such as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" are so bad they're fun to watch. THIS IS NOT ONE. ""The Dungeon of Horror"" might be the worst movie I've ever seen (some of anyway. I HAD to fast forward through a lot of it!). Fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age, there may be worse movies I've seen, but thankfully, I can't remember them. The sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint. The special effects looked like a fifth grader's C+ diorama set in a shoebox. The movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the Marquis shoots and kills his servant. He then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim, who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it, without the gun having been reloaded! This movie was so bad my DVD copy only had name credits. I guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated. Though I guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn't needed. This movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as ""The Manipulator"", the worst movie I have ever seen with an actual (one time) Hollywood leading man-Mickey Rooney. The only time I would recommend watching ""The Dungeon of Harrow"" (or ""The Manipulator"" for that matter) would be if someone were to pay you. (I'm kind of cheap) I'd have to have $7 or $8 bucks for ""Dungeon"" and at least ten for ""Manipulator"". phil-the never out of the can cinematographer,negative";Movie
"This movie took me by surprise. The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation. After that, we're plunged into a semi-cheesy production, betraying its low budget. The characters, typical American teens, are introduced slowly, with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this. By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Hills Have Eyes."" But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out. Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of ""House on the Haunted Hill."" The set-up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking?,positive";Movie
"Though I'd heard that ""Cama de Gato"" was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade, I watched it giving it a chance; after all, first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to ""Cama de Gato"", they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too), made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it's not even funny-bad.<br /><br />We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape, spanking, murder, the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage, get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially ""Kids"" and ""Bully""), but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling), but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). <br /><br />Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc). Damn, he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it.<br /><br />It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's, Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in ""Carandiru"", ""Lavoura Arcaica"", ""Proibido Proibir""). Here, he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped ""actors"" in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn).<br /><br />The film opens and ends with real interviews with ""typical"" (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as ""proof"" of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). <br /><br />With its dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom, ""Cama de Gato"" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. ""Cama de Gato"" is best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and forgotten.,negative";Movie
An unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon. I remember this very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well it starts out a bit dark, a dog who escaped the pound, and gets killed by an old friend, ends up in Heaven, and comes back. But it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons, like the dream sequence of Charlie, but everything else was okay,and the songs were fair. A memorable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love that guy, ahehehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, may God rest her soul, poor girl, she didn't deserve to die, but she is in Heaven now, all good people go to Heaven. Overall this is a very good animated movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to put anime and Disney to shame. Recommended for the whole family. And know this, if you have the original video of this, you'll find after the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message, gotta love that guy, ahehehe.,positive;Movie
This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.<br /><br />In sitting through this, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell got no more than a single truly funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent, cringe-worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit.<br /><br />Far from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blows its whole record-breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot. The movie spends the first half building up to the construction of Evan's ark, but by the end, we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages. The movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark, flood, and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.,negative;Movie
It is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance. I had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing. If you loved Bulgakov's book you would be, understandably, afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art-film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen. There are a couple examples of this with the Master and Margarita. As complex and far-fetched as the story is, the movie leaves out nothing. It is as if the filmmaker read Bulgakov's work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score--with not a note missed. Why can't we find such talent here in the U.S. ? So now my favorite book and movie have the same title.,positive;Movie
This movie is very violent, yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The movie start off with action star Leo Fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career, when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption, black mail and murder. This is where the killings start. From start finish Fong delivers in this must see action caper. This movie also co-stars Richard Roundtree.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film as a child but as I got older I realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good. I would not recommend this film and the action is very, very bad.,negative;Movie
The day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of Azumi's fate as an assassin, fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga.<br /><br />That's as poetical as I'll get when talking about Azumi 2: Death or Love, because when I cringed over the heavy sentimentality of House of Flying Daggers and complained about the credibility of Aya Ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin, after watching Azumi 2 I started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before.<br /><br />Not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience. In Azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape. But I won't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in Azumi's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma. By the way, Chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of Go Go, minus the cool weapon and sense of menace.<br /><br />This brings me to the final blow which is the action, simply disguised in the title as the 'Death' side of the epic. In the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons. To no one's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily. In Azumi 1, the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between Azumi and Bijomaru in comparison to the fights in Azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter. I am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both Azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched.<br /><br />The romance side of Azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution.<br /><br />As a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation, I won't lie and I'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first Azumi film, but I'll step right up and say that after watching Azumi 2, the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece. For what it's worth, Azumi 2: Death or Love could have gone straight to video, with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins, doing their best to restore the peace, with an unwavering courage to die trying.,negative;Movie
"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say ""I'll bite yer leg off!"" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.,negative";Movie
"A very ordinary made-for-tv product, ""Tyson"" attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect, fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing, and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes Tyson even remotely interesting. A lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans.,negative";Movie
"I'm sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn't. You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy, slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department.<br /><br />I just sat there through most of the movie thinking ""Is this supposed to be funny"" and ""This is the guy from Tenacious D right?"". The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction. You'll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn't. I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up. It didn't. 90 minutes later I'd barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful.<br /><br />It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop. Yeah it's like that.<br /><br />I've enjoyed some of Jack Black's earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man. If you do this to us again Jack I'm gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something. At the least give you a serious talking to.<br /><br />I know it's a cliché but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons....,negative";Movie
I haven't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting QUEEN OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.<br /><br />Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.<br /><br />However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.<br /><br />The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up? Scene after scene, I shook my head reminiscing about the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when low budget was done right.<br /><br />There are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. Props to Aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace. She might have become a renowned actress, had her life not been taken from us so prematurely, for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second-rate vampire movies out there. The director of this movie went on to direct a new Battlestar Galactica mini series if that tells you anything.<br /><br />JY<br /><br />Jimboduck-dot-com,positive;Movie
While I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. Although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember The Gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series.,negative;Movie
Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 Movie and Video Guide. What film was he looking at? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. It is fantastic. It is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. One can only guess as to his reason. I suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.,positive;Movie
"I don't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club. They are today's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century. Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don't happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of ""life after death"" or ""god"" or ""sin"" or ""the devil"" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. Sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. However, The 700 Club is in a class by itself. They are truly a cult. While I believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. The 700 Club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of 'cult' but due to The 700 Club's vast wealth (conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip) they are above the law in this country. For those of you who have seen the movie ""The Matrix"" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth: the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.<br /><br />In less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks. But in today's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them, we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague. <br /><br />The television ratings system and the ""V"" chip on TV's should also have a rating called ""R"" for religion, so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape, such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country, from themselves and their children.,negative";Movie
"If you wish to see Shakespeare's masterpiece in its entirety, I suggest you find this BBC version. Indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but Jacoby's performance as Hamlet and Patrick Stewart's as Claudius are well worth the effort.<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me how clear ""Hamlet"" is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the Bard. Every film version of ""Hamlet"" has tinkered with its structure. Olivier concentrated on Hamlet's indecision, Gibson on his passions. Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlet's character together with the aid of Shakespeare's full script.<br /><br />Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says ""I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious..."" Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so. He must ""out"" the King's secret and here is the tragedy! At the moment Hamlet is successful in displaying Claudius' guilt in public, he has opportunity to kill him and does not. WHY? He wants it ALL! He wants revenge, the throne AND the damnation of Claudius' soul in hell. Hamlet OVERREACHES himself in classic tragic form. His own HUBRIS is his undoing. He kills Polonius thinking it is Claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet himself.,positive";Movie
"The Golden Door is the story of a Sicilian family's journey from the Old World (Italy) to the New World (America). Salvatore, a middle-aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in Sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the New World.<br /><br />The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. This is shown as Salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left (donkeys, goats and rabbits) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the New World. I thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the New World; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. The most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the New World. This shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the Old and New Worlds. This shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise.<br /><br />As later contrasted to how the New World visually looks, the Old World seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy New World. I thought it was particularly interesting that the Statue of Liberty is never shown through the fog at Ellis Island, but is remained hidden. I think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the Statue of Liberty stands for: ""Give me your poor, your tired, your hungry"" seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the New World. Once they arrived in the Americas, they had to go through rather humiliating tests (i.e. delousing, mathematics, puzzles, etc.) in order to prove themselves as fit for the New World. These tests completely changed the perspectives of the Sicilian people. In particular, Salvatore's mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the New World, feeling more violated than treated with respect. Where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the New World would provide, the reality of what the New World required was disparaging and rude. Salvatore doesn't change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the New World would be like versus what the New World actually was seemed disappointing to him. This attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him. Their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted.<br /><br />The film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society. Cleanliness, marriage and intelligence are prerequisites. Adhering to these rules is to prevent disease, immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating. Perhaps this is a commentary on how America has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct. Though the rules seemed rigid, they were there to protect and help the people flourish.,positive";Movie
Nifty little episode played mainly for laughs, but with clever dollop of suspense. Somehow a Martian has snuck aboard a broken-down bus on its way to nowhere, but which passenger is it, (talk about your illegal immigrants!). All-star supporting cast, from wild-eyed Jack Elam (hamming it up shamelessly), to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, then I say let's open the borders!), to cruel-faced John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with familiar faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a nice turn from Bill Kendis as the bus driver).

I watched mask in the 80's and it's currently showing on Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears. I never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just plain awful! It is no where near in the same league as The Transformers, He-man or Thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made. I only watch it on Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes on straight after it (that's if mask doesn't put me to sleep first).

"Phantasm ....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....erm.....terrible.<br /><br />Even though i would love to stick up for this film, i quite simply can't. The movie seems to have ""sold out"". First bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other Phatasms). Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.<br /><br />The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B.<br /><br />(Possible SPOILER coming Up)<br /><br />To me this film seems like a filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.<br /><br />Overall very, VERY disappointing. 3 / 10,negative";Movie
"Ludicrous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems appealing to Amidala, 5 years his senior.

Ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of ""fantastic"", ""wonderful"", etc.).<br /><br />Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. Doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.<br /><br />I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations.

"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br /><br />As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in ""Santa Fe Trail"", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's ""Little Big Man"". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br /><br />The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - ""You take glory with you when it's your time to go"".,positive";Movie
The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Steven Seagal would have been beaten to pulp by Seagal's driving, but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie.<br /><br />It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to enjoy the action, and do not expect a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you may have, it will reduce your chance of getting a headache.<br /><br />I does give me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies.,negative;Movie
Interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno's replacing Carson as host of the Tonight Show. Film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.<br /><br />The film does a good job of sparking viewers' interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders, particularly of the NBC executives. The portrayal of Ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting, I thought.<br /><br />Still, many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon, and some of the acting seemed perfunctory. Nevertheless, an interesting story.,negative;Movie
Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion, respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare, I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman, a favorite of mine. John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's film but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence, am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Production's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?,positive;Movie
A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating 'THE THING'. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever.<br /><br />The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well.<br /><br />Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film...its certainly a gruesome masterpiece.<br /><br />Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge. Sit down and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime.<br /><br />Utterly brilliant.<br /><br />Ten Out Of Ten.,positive;Movie
I absolutely love this film. Everything about it. It almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen. The way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece, very original and creative. I related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some. I'm really glad I ran across this movie. If only there were more genius' like justin out there!,positive;Movie
No one can say I wasn't warned as I have read the reviews (both user & external), but like most of us attracted to horror movies... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room, but you know that's horror aficionados are always dying to know what's in there even if we know it'll be bad).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it pretends to be real (who cares...gimmicks are allowed), or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) or even because the movie is so bad (and I am being polite here). What really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off at that.<br /><br />I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo BWP then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. The movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!,negative;Movie
A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch.,positive;Movie
"If you liked William Hickey in ""Prizzi's Honor"", he resurrects his character, as Don Anthony in ""Mob Boss"". This is a very weak ""Godfather"" satire with few laughs. Stuart Whitman looks perplexed as to what he's doing in this schlock-fest? Morgan Fairchild's performance is one of the better efforts in the movie, and that alone is not a good sign for sure. Eddie Deezen vacillates between ""Three Stooges"" slapstick and a bad Woody Allen imitation. Fatally flawed, ""Mob Boss"" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases, hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom, and numerous other nonsense. - MERK,negative";Movie
I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films. I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting. Some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation.,negative;Movie
"I just started watching The Show around July. I found it by mistake, I was channel surfing during a Vacation. It is a great show, I just wish it wasn't on so late at night. It's on at 12:30 AM. As a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time.<br /><br />I read some comments. I did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the 60's and not believing that this stuff can happen.<br /><br />I grew up in the 60's. I'm Hispanic and I had a ""White"" boyfriend plus we had black friends in High School. I believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color.<br /><br />I can't wait till the show goes on DVD so I can buy it.

"This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director.

I have just given a 10 for Thieves Highway, I mention this for two reasons one to prove I'm not a git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night.<br /><br />We all know pretty Woman is a chick flick but you can't avoid them all, they'll eventually get you. Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. <br /><br />Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.<br /><br />Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Guys who like this film will not even have realized that old Eddy has less charm than a calculator, as they probably don't either so it wont have registered. More importantly anyone who likes this film will hate 'Thieves Highway' a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject.<br /><br />I'll finish on a song:<br /><br />Pretty woman hangin round the street Pretty woman, the kind I like to treat Pretty woman, I don't believe you You're not the truth No one could spend as much as you Mercy<br /><br />Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me<br /><br />Pretty woman, shop a while Pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, sell your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah Pretty woman, look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me..and I'll pay you..I'll treat you right,negative;Movie

She is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.<br /><br />and shouldn't chase tell her he likes her? its not that hard! really!

"This movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no ""good plot"" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a Jackie Chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch Jackie Chan FOR THE FIGHT SCENES, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other American films from that era and even later you will realize that Jackie Chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while American movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what Jackie Chan was doing at the time. Porn is watched for the porn, Jackie Chan is watched for the ACTION, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. Sure the middle of the movie was boring, VERY BORING, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. This did change the way how American action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. If you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan's, hes pure in everyway. He literally makes American movies look like a walk in the park, and even in TODAYS movies. American movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece,positive";Movie
"I saw this at the London Film Festival last night, apparently the shorter version. James McNally's summary of the content of the film is very good. Nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation, homogenisation, the effect of the mass media, the power of capital and the need for diversity.<br /><br />The film is shot on hand-held DV which some might find offputting, but which does enable Nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment.<br /><br />Despite the sprawling feel of the film, the editing is very sharp, not only giving us a parade of the world's dogs, but also undercutting a number of interviewees' comments with somewhat contradictory visual images, and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves. To a degree this evoked Michael Moore's recent work (although Nossiter operates in a more subtle way), but probably the roots of the film go back to Marcel Ophuls' ""The Sorrow and the Pity"", both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of 'salt of the earth' French peasants as the stars. De Montille pere et fils were present at the LFF screening and answered questions afterwards. We do indeed all need a little disorder - bravo Hubert!<br /><br />Overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people, and organise our world.,positive";Movie
"I can't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring, certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />In a no-budget way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />This film should be avoided at all costs. It's one of those ""festival films"" that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it ""different"", therefore good.<br /><br />Bad film-making is not ""different"", it's just bad film-making.,negative";Movie
"This movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.<br /><br />This guy John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by Johns plan. However a glitch turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. Although calm and emotionless on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.<br /><br />What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message ""you would have probably acted likewise"".<br /><br />Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, ""almost"" only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.<br /><br />The pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. Like the idea of the ""rude awakening"" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society's machine, the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings (""Welcome to the machine!""). I bet that in the end, John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.<br /><br />Thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a sequel! And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, I am sure of it.,positive";Movie
Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this movie was made should give any young<br /><br />aspiring film maker hope. Any screenplay you might have thought of using to<br /><br />line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this<br /><br />movie made me realize that Boa vs. Python was not that bad after all. It probably would have been better to do this movie in Claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to<br /><br />make your toward your TV set's cocoon of cheese that surrounds it.,negative;Movie
"This sports a nice, deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but talk, and more talk. Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other. <br /><br />The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it's really a ""chick flick"" and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network.<br /><br />There was a quick murder scene and then more talk. By halfway through, they had lost me. <br /><br />By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here.,negative";Movie
"I think this movie has got it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. IS REALLY funny(you know, the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).Despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times.<br /><br />There are so many funny parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. On that part, I kept saying ""Remember, Remember?""to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his ""Strange dream"" and how he was ""Superman"". I LOVED that part, although it has been a while since I saw it, so I don't remember that part. Everything the actors said were funny, like how Kurt says, ""I worship you, like a GOD!"" to the robot.<br /><br />Although there was some bad things, in all it was a GREAT movie. Man, I can't stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );,positive";Movie
"Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at the high school in a small Indiana city. He is finally getting married to Emily (Joan Cusack), much to his parents delight. The town is abuzz, too, because one of its own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) has been nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, is watching the Academy Awards on television as Cameron is declared the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man, in part, because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school. You guessed it, its Howard! But, Howard has never ""come out""; in fact, he believes he is straight! With the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and observing the happenings, will Howard and Emily go ahead and get married? Or, is Howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony? This is a wonderful, funny, and humane film about a gay man and his situation. As the man-who-did-not-realize-he-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touching. The rest of the cast is equally fine, with Cusack a stitch as the mixed-up fiancé and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck, and others on hand to delight the audience as well. The costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely Indiana heartland is beautiful. Then, too, the script, the direction, and the production are very, very nice. But, the insightful, humorous, and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film's best asset, no doubt. For those who would be offended by a gay-themed film, yes, just skip over this one. But, for everyone who wants to laugh heartily, and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time, this is definitely the best film out there.,positive";Movie
When the opening shot is U.S. Marines seriously disrespecting the U.S. flag, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. There is a military adviser credited, who is also apparently a retired U.S. Marine, making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol, and law, went unnoticed. Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. The U.S. government is still finding the missing from WWII, and it takes months to identify the remains. Military shot down remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been positively identified, or after years of red tape. Here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks. Maybe this happens in Denmark, but not in the U.S. Clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with, or respect for, the U.S. military.<br /><br />Beyond that, there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash. Having a script that worked might have helped, but this one seems to have been made up on the spot, working from Cliffs Notes. There's no way to know if the script was this awful originally, or if it was the auteur, or the middle-management kids at the studio who bear responsibility. Either way, this is an awful movie that should have never been made.,negative;Movie
"We usually think of the British as the experts at rendering great adventure from the Imperial age, with the likes of The Four Feathers (1939) and Zulu, simply because the Imperial age was, for the most part, British. Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.<br /><br />America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who, despite her gentility, is smitten by the rough, manly nobility of her captor, who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn. (Politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of ""native"" peoples or cultures can rest assured, that the way Arabs and Muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage.) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.<br /><br />Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"". There is a transcendent scene at the end, when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing Moor on his white steed. This is high adventure at its best.,positive";Movie
"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while...what with all it's raving reviews, nominations and media attention. And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. However, as the movie wore on, me and my whole family were bored out of our wits. The singing just kept coming, one after the other. I mean seriously, just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT.<br /><br />Furthermore, I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of a drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any emotion for that character. The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot, but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care, which goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago, and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesn't really care about an overall story, yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances.,negative";Movie
One of Starewicz's longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange. The dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold, but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters. With the help of a stuffed cat, the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death. The Mascot features new techniques I have not yet seen in Starewicz's films. The addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop-motion animation makes for a new twist on Starewicz's old style of puppetry. Live scenes of moving cars and people's feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh. The honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and Starewicz's utilization of the new technology seems like old hat. New puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil's club scene. Twigss and newspaper shreds come to life. Skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks. Characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses. A new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene. Overall, Starewicz is able to update his style of film-making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work.,positive;Movie
"Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu. Being a male, I'm probably not qualified to totally understand it, but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start. It isn't as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher. What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters. Each has their own ""thing"" that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didn't go for cheap comedy when it could have. It didn't try to pound a lesson into us. The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light. I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly, but, within this world, it needed to happen. Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people.,positive";Movie
Prussic gas, a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip, and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish. The inspectors at Scotland Yard, Higgins(IJoachim Fuchsberger)and his superior Sir John(Siegfried Schürenberg)certainly have their hands full with this case. It all seems to center around student Ann Portland(Uschi Glas), who, when she turns 21, is to inherit a great deal of wealth. The girls who are targeted share a room with Ann, but the reason for their murders remains a mystery SY's finest must figure out. The staff of the girls' dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise, talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip. Two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation. It's a clever scheme where a driver, Greaves(Günter Meisner)meets the convicts(..who hide in a barrel)who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard. Taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind, he gives them orders on who to kill and how. Uncovering this operation is a top priority for Higgins and Sir John for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening. Under suspicion are girls' dormitory headmistress, her author brother, a sweaty, incredibly nervous chemistry teacher, a snooping gardener, and the Bannister. Some are red herrings until they are disposed of, throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered. The ending features multiple twists. <br /><br />Out of the Krimi films I've seen, THE COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS is the closest to a giallo with it's colorful killer, a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects, & sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory. I think you can also see the influence of James Bond on this particular Krimi film with the villain mastermind's secret hideout with an alligator pit(..which isn't used), the fake bible/water pistol, when opened, fires the gas into the face of startled victims, the Greaves' Royles Royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat, and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming. Many might consider Sir John a liability due to his bumbling, buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines Higgins' abilities to get at the truth(..perhaps poking fun at know-it-all British inspectors who harm a case more than solve it)..I felt he was used as comedy relief, particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims, often misunderstanding what are told to him. Higgins, using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator, instead follows the clues/facts, often avoiding Sir John as much as possible. Capable direction by the reliable Alfred Vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed, and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content..the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect, any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls' executions. I'd say this may be one of the best(..if not the best)examples of the Krimi genre, for it keeps you guessing, always one more ace up it's sleeve..the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye-opening(..and, you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off).,positive;Movie
I was very lucky to see this film as part of the Melbourne International Film Festival 2005 only a few days ago. I must admit that I am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life. I also love the majority of Scandinavian cinematic offerings, there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. Character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth. This is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive. I am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness.,positive;Movie
This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. There's a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all. The whole thing is just laughable.,negative;Movie

I saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. Then again, that was when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-ized bitch she is today. Anyway, this film really struck me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendship films. How far would you really go for your best friend? I was moved to tears at the end, and still tear up when I watch it now (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater, I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her. This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend. However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you'd do something like that for her....,positive;Movie
"I've seen this film literally over 100 times...it's absolutely jam-packed with entertainment!!! Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981)I never thought an actor could capture the ""intensity"" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles, until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones...this film captures his best performance!!!,positive";Movie
"The three main characters are all hopeless, and yet you only feel sorry for one of them: Ernesto, hopelessly devoted to Mercedes. This was part of the frustration: screaming at Mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no-good Harry, to no avail.<br /><br />Then there's the satisfaction: Steve Buscemi has a great part as a transvestite, and Harvey Keitel's moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap TV movie is incredible. When you least expect it, Quentin Tarintino is doing half a monologue, and Anthony Quinn turns Ernesto into a wealthy man.<br /><br />Time and again great moments appear in the story, but in the end it's hard to know what to feel about this movie. It doesn't have a happy ending, or even a complete one, but it somehow feels right.<br /><br />This movie is strange, but then so am I; no wonder I liked it.,positive";Movie
"Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. She appears like a fresh scrubbed face ""tween"" slight and stringy, but undeniably Reese.<br /><br />I have always liked her as an actor, and had no idea she started this young with her career, go figure. I actually gained some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on. I say that because whenever I have watched her perform, the characters thus far, in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character, quite nicely in fact.<br /><br />Anyway, my first film experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese did with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed that was her first time up ""at bat"" Not so, well done Reese,positive";Movie
This game ranks above all so far. I had the honor of playing mine on PS2 so the graphics were really good. The voice acting was above standard. The difficulty level is just right. Wesker has to be the best characters in the RE series in my opinion. The story amazed me and took many different twist that I wasn't expecting. The only rating this game deserves is great.,positive;Movie
This movie is not worth anything. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of stuff, flip to Hollywood movies! This totally is a disgrace to the Bollywood name. Neal N Nikki seriously sucked! Never watch this movie. As for the actors, it appears the acting genes skipped a generation. Tanisha couldn't have worn less and Uday Chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director's spoiled son. (All of that Halla Re was amazingly stupid) The songs are eh, and I hope the director did not spend to much money on it...... Bottom line, I hated the movie. Do not let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it! Buy the CD, if you must. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it is better then the movie.,negative;Movie
"This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. It's certainly all been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special.<br /><br />What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. She's married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson who's the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. That doesn't sit well with either Dianne Foster who is Robinson and Stanwyck's daughter, nor with Lita Milan who is Keith's Mexican girl friend.<br /><br />The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but Glenn Ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. He's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth, ""I'm a peaceable man."" Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men.<br /><br />The Fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford would do another western, Jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.<br /><br />There's enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.,positive";Movie
Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely barking!).,negative;Movie
"This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs ""Sini Ne"" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesn't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.,negative";Movie
"I Feel the Niiiiiight Heat! I feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART-beat! Something ain't right!"" Theme song written by B.J. Cook from Skylark- David Foster's old band and wife. She also wrote the memorable theme from CBC's ""Airwaves."" OH Night Heat! What a program! Well-written, well-acted and totally classic. Crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end. I'd like to think this is really what detectives do/did. Giambone was a real favourite! On a Canadian tip, I learned EVERY Canadian actor's name and style from guest spots done on Night Heat. Everyone passed through the Night Heat set and like Law & Order, it was story-driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama.,positive";Movie
This movie fails miserably on every level. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east. Maybe if we're lucky they'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life? My god, I can't think of anything I've ever seen that was this bad. I'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film. If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film, I'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless. That's my two cents.,negative;Movie
Yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.<br /><br />The acting was good (apart from Thewlis)<br /><br />Stone really has a talent with this role. She's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.She really impressed me(like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. He really sucked.<br /><br />Overall, this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.,positive;Movie
Based on a Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest. A Victorian scientist Dr. Abner Perry(Peter Cushing)invents a giant burrowing machine, which he and his American partner(Doug McClure)use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters.<br /><br />Cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying. Instead of being a bold adventurer, he comes across effeminate. On the other hand McClure overacted enough to make himself also laughable. Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.,negative;Movie
I have seen this film at least 100 times and I am still excited by it, the acting is perfect and the romance between Joe and Jean keeps me on the edge of my seat, plus I still think Bryan Brown is the tops. Brilliant Film.,positive;Movie
This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something about it... But every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. Once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? Yay! We've solved the murder! Now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. There is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.,negative;Movie
"This movie was so bad it was funny! For awhile there I thought I was actually watching a parody of a bad movie (a la ""For Your Consideration""). The ""cliffhanger"" scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt. The script was dreadful enough, but coupled with Sean Young's terrible acting -- especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail (complete with flashbacks) while dangling off a cliff -- makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing got made. First of all, how did such a bad script get the green light? How did star actors get attached? Were they at low points in their careers? Questions, questions.,negative";Movie
Meryl Streep is such a genius. Well, at least as an actress. I know she's been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she nails the accent every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more remarkable. I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of interesting things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty good film. A bit different. Grade: B,positive;Movie
'Airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for Universal Studios to try and work a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.<br /><br />Bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy sticks his hand out of Concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon, and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /><br />Not really related to the other 'Airport' films.,negative;Movie
"Supposedly a ""social commentary"" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's, ""Nightmare"" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised ""babe in prison"" movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of ""Gilligan's Island"") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. <br /><br />,negative";Movie
"OK, I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.<br /><br />But we decided it to watch it anyway. Just for hilarity purposes.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but this has got to be, one of THE worst films in history.<br /><br />It began off alright, and we thought ""Ok this might actually be OK"". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken.<br /><br />It began when the ""mysterious paint baller"" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser/Australian (I say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified), who's acting might I just say, was abysmal.<br /><br />Then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. The paint ball finals.<br /><br />The only thing I did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default.<br /><br />And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. Critical Damage. I mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like ""The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ"" or something. Or that's what the film should of been called anyway.,negative";Movie
"Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! ""The Brain"" takes place in a typical quiet-American town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TV-guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. Under the label of ""independent thinkers"", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it's up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the ""evil"" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made ""Bloody Birthday"" (guilty pleasure of mine) and ""Plague"". Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her ""masterpiece"". In her debut, she was credited as 'runaway model' and in ""3 men and a baby"", her character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'. I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress,negative";Movie
"Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :<br /><br />"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" <br /><br />"" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" <br /><br />"" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" <br /><br />This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained <br /><br />Bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of "" The Doctor "" , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents <br /><br />As you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like The Doctor's sister being a lesbian so some T&A can be included <br /><br />In many ways it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons . Believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed,negative";Movie
"Well, here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film-making! The rudimentary premise of ""What's the matter with Helen?"" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! In the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington (""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"") and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (""HushHushSweet Charlotte"") in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. We're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. There's never a dull moment in ""What's the matter with Helen"", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters. She's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees' and Michael Myers' combined! There are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like Michéal MacLiammóir as the cocky elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies' house. There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an Oscar!) are breathtaking.,positive";Movie
Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.<br /><br />It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don't even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). People flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It's as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try watching the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do, too.

I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. It's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! Great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.,negative;Movie
"This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it.<br /><br />Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth.<br /><br />But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.<br /><br />I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.<br /><br />In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity.<br /><br />And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /><br />I'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.,negative";Movie
"Black comedy isn't always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don't often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. There doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987.<br /><br />DeVito plays an odd mamma's boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but he clearly doesn't have the guts to actually do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. ""The night was...."" Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's ex-wife. Once it appears he has done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isn't too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.,positive";Movie
Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was hooked instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still sore.<br /><br />Way to go, FX.,positive;Movie
"Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabbé); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there, he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it's worth the effort.,positive";Movie
I accept that most 50's horror aren't scary by today's standards, but what the hell is this? When you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast. Instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on Earth....yeah which is what the people wanted.<br /><br />The overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast....but the title really kills the movie. Night of the Beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn't any blood to speak of.<br /><br />I like how the 50's movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one. This movie isn't the worst i've ever seen but its almost up there.<br /><br />2 out of 10,negative;Movie
"Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole ""story"" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!!!) (shudder) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.<br /><br />Fun fact: This film is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of scary huh?,negative";Movie
"There is a difference between a ""film,"" and a ""movie."" A film, regardless of quality, is ready for public consumption. A movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder. In my time as a viewer, I have seen may examples of both.<br /><br />On September 19, I attended a screening of writer/director Jon Satejowski's ""Donnybrook."" Now having read the script and having seen two different cuts (a rough cut and the ""finished"" product) of this piece, I can safely say it is a movie. And a student movie, at that. It is, for lack of a better word, competent, which is to say, the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images. The visuals are, for the most part, static and unimpressive, and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots, with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters. I understand that this is a modestly budgeted film, but some visual flair would have been appreciated, and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested.<br /><br />Granted, there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written, engrossing story and some sharp dialog. Steven Soderbergh's ""sex, lies, and videotape"" comes immediately to mind. This movie, however, has neither. The main story is weak and unfocused. If the main plot is Davie trying to mend his relationship with his father, then I feel this movie misses the point. What I got out of it is that Davie's main aspiration is to ""change the face of rock 'n' roll."" However, we see very little activity on his part to show this. While there is one dream sequence at the beginning, and an impromptu performance of his at the end, all we seem to get are scenes of Davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar. We are simply told that Davie has played a lot of gigs, but we never see him in full rock out mode. Next time, SHOW don't TELL the audience. Anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this. Also, Davie doesn't look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970's; he looks like he'd be more comfortable in the early days of rock 'n' roll, posing as James Dean's less talented brother. In the meantime, the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters, and story threads, that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story, are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency (i.e. the subplot involving Terry's father). If I want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction, I will consider watching ""Napolean Dynamite"" again, a film I could barely make it through the first time.<br /><br />As for the above mentioned dialog scenes, I guess I should mention that they are few and extremely far between. Is it too much to ask for characters who do speak? I don't think it is. When the characters do speak, it is in short, choppy sentences; collections of oh so insightful questions, angered grunts or wildly over-the-top outbursts. These characters simply do not behave like normal, rational people. Working with material like this, it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film, Al Hudson's, and that's just because he's doing a poor imitation of Sam Elliott for his time on screen. A good director, or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director, would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them. However, with Satejowski being so close to the material, he simply doesn't see them, or, if he does, he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it'll hurt his creative vision. Being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner, is the mark of a self-indulgent, misguided fool. Just ask Rob Schneider. <br /><br />In the end, we are left with a poor, high-school-set, knock-off of Zach Braff's amazing ""Garden State"" combined with the equally amazing ""Velvet Goldmine,"" two films far more worthy of your time.<br /><br />Now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review, allow me to offer this. The best I can do is compliment Mr. Satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see. However, the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur. This is a student movie, nothing more, nothing less. If the movie holds any promise (and let's face it, at this point, it isn't going to come from the acting, writing, or directing), it is this: If, IF, the people associated with this film are willing, then, please, learn from this movie, file it away, and use the lessons learned on your next attempt; don't attack your critics, or have friend or family do it for you. If you are able to do this, maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution, worthy of being called a ""film.""<br /><br />I am your audience, and I am willing to watch.,negative";Movie
please re-watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min TV episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life, truly an awful film. tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns, also mr briss's accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras, and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god-awful piece of crap..........batman and robin all is forgiven,negative;Movie
"Finally! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs. This is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass. It's all about football and its funny, its really funny. The director says ""The places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness."" The non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. Excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. It has won the Jury Grand Prize, Berlin, 2006. Dear reader, it's near-perfect.

"Sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. If you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... This (unfortunately) was not the case with ""Satan's Whip"".<br /><br />Written and directed by Jason Maran, ""Satan's Whip"" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. I'm guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and I found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. The story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made ""Satan's Whip"" one to forget quite quickly. I will give it a ""4"" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time.,negative";Movie
"Tainted look at kibbutz life<br /><br />This film is less a cultural story about a boy's life in a kibbutz, but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general. In the first two minutes of the movie, the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves. And it's all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical ""kibbutznikim."" Besides the two main characters, a clinically depressed woman and her young son, every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of wellevil. <br /><br />The story centers on how the kibbutz, like some sort of cult, slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows. There is no happiness, no joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Every character/situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression etc. For example, while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy  his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his ""jewish"" physical appearance and brutish personality. He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother. He treats these volunteers like trash. After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn't seen in a long time due to his military service, he orders, Quote  ""Linda, go take shower and I cum in two minutes."" <br /><br />There is one other ""good"" character in this movie  a European foreigner who plays the mother's boyfriend. When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother's son, the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist's arm. He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for ""violent"" behavior against one of the kibbutz members. More hypocrisy: The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18, or without love and gives an account of the actual act that's supposed to be humorous for the audience, but is really just stupid. She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy's mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult. Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders. The mother apparently can't ""escape"" the kibbutz, although in reality, anyone was/is always free to come and go as they choose. It's a mystery how the boy's father died, but you can rest assured, the kibbutz ""drove him to it"" and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless, wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son. <br /><br />That's the gist of this movie. One dimensional characters, over dramatization, dry performances, and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience's head  that kibbutz life was degrading, miserable and even deadly for those who didn't ""fit in."" I feel sorry for the guy who made this film  obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz. But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs.,negative";Movie
"(When will I ever learn-?) The ecstatic reviewer on NPR made me think this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Please allow me to vent my spleen...<br /><br />I will admit: the setting, presumably New York City, has never been so downright ugly and unappealing. I am reminded that the 70's was a bad decade for men's fashion and automobiles. And all the smoking-! If the plan was to cheapen the characters, it succeeded.<br /><br />For a film to work (at least, in my simple estimation), there has to be at least ONE sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close, and I could not wait for him to finish off Nicky. If a stray shot had struck Mikey, well, it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most.<br /><br />I can't remember when I detested a film as strongly. I suppose I'm a rube who doesn't dig ""art"" flicks. Oh, well.,negative";Movie
"""Lost"", ""24"", ""Carnivale"", ""Desperate Housewifes""...the list goes on and on. These, and a bunch of other high-quality, shows proves that we're in the middle of a golden age in television history. ""Lost"" is pure genius. Incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a TV-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. Anyone who isn't hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. It may have its problems, when watching only one episode a week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to watch this. Hope they keep it up (as I'm sure they do).,positive";Movie
"Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Unfortunately, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors; it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. Still, Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.,negative";Movie
This is a must-see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real-life adventure and its sense of morality. Darius Goes West is an amazing roller-coaster of a story. We live the lives of Darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime. Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a disease which affects all the muscles in his body. He is confined to a wheelchair, and needs round-the-clock attention. So how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6,000 mile round-trip to the West Coast and back?

"The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. When war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the ""wandering sickness"", a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />""Things to Come"" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. The ""Wings Over the World"" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in Massey's end of movie speech. Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an ""all the universe or nothing"" mindset.<br /><br />The film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film ""Metropolis"". As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />""Things to Come"" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? It's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.,positive";Movie
"Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.<br /><br />Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. It's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. Being Fulci flick, you need to know it's gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's a hard to archive. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about Fulci, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this IS the goriest Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where Fulci says ""making gore movies is kind of a sickness"" Ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most of the Italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. If you are fun of the Fulci, make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat ""Its only a movie"" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: Chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face...,positive";Movie
"What an incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and from the size of the jar he's been shot about fifty times by now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico. Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear. And you'll never hear another screenplay feature the word ""butthorn"" either. Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from ""Lethal Weapon"" and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in ""Red Dawn"" a few years earlier. After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies. Sadly he'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in ""Every Which Way You Can."",negative";Movie
I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it's got a good ending even though I didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings I figured it out over time and that's the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time.<br /><br />THIS IS BEST MOVIE.,positive;Movie
"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out ""we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?"" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars"" and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written ""you're f**ked"". When prompted for the map, Carlos responds ""well the map says we're f**ked"". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. ""Nice hearing from you, Carlos"", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with ""shut the f**k up, man"" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.<br /><br />,negative";Movie
"Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang isn't really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard-edged action is your thing.<br /><br />Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.<br /><br />A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.<br /><br />Of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.<br /><br />Whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess, with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth seeking out.,positive";Movie

I have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say. Even though this movie did not get the best comments, this movie made my day. It got me thinking. What a false world this is.<br /><br />What do you do when your most loved ones deceive you. It's said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. Same way some people are such that they are never grateful. This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself. <br /><br />A brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone.<br /><br />Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan gave a good performance. The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show. Her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance. Chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself.<br /><br />A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His movies always give some message to the audience. His movies are like novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who's novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message for the audience. They are entertaining as well as lesson-giving.,positive;Movie

I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie, but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying, too.<br /><br />Overall, well, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken, by the way.,negative;Movie
I am not so old that I can't remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple times. But some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells.<br /><br />From the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. <br /><br />If you ever saw Shakes the Clown you know how unfunny Bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits' hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into Hollywood,negative;Movie
"In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />""Panic in the Streets"" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Pânico nas Ruas"" (""Panic in the Streets""),positive";Movie
The box is why I originally picked up this movie and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been duped. I had thought this movie would be something like a Road Trip/Eurotrip/American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. The unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you. The acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy. It appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon put its name on this. DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on this.,negative;Movie
There have been many documentaries that I have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost. But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at the very worst an act of murder. Like most people, when the siege at Waco was occurring I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. After seeing this, I think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the U.S. government through his eccentric actions. Sure, there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site, the clueless testimony of Janet Reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats. Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current U.S. senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I'm a Democrat, pretty left-leaning too. After seeing his actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. I even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important.,positive;Movie
I saw this movie last night and thought it was decent. It has it's moments I guess you would say. Some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool, and some of the location shots were very authentic. I won't be putting this movie in my DVD collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting. I guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre. The action is good, the acting is decent, the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion, and the story is pretty interesting. 7 out of ten,positive;Movie
Yes, I call this a perfect movie. Not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. It's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.<br /><br />The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.<br /><br />I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America. The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night, made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.,positive;Movie
"I would like to know if anyone know how I can get a copy of the movie, ""That's the way of the World"". It's been about 30 years since I've seen this movie, and I would like to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes. It was unfortunate that this group didn't take off like their counterparts in the early 70's, but as previously stated, racial tension existed in the United States which prohibited equalized exposure for the African American musical groups. It is good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continuing their success. I would like to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention.

"I saw the movie ""Hoot"" and then I immediately decided to comment it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that I might harm them actually. (I am currently 15) What so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and Enjoy!,positive";Movie
"I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.<br /><br />This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great ""dad"".<br /><br />If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.,positive";Movie
When I first saw this film around 6 months ago, I considered it interesting, but little more. But it stuck with me. That interest grew and grew, and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself. I purchased the Criterion DVD box set, and it turns out that I was right the second time. Alexander Nevsky is a great film. It is rousing, and I'm sure it succeeded in its main aim: propaganda against the Germans.<br /><br />That is the most common criticism against this film, and against Eisenstein, that it is merely propagandist and nothing else. It's untrue. He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived. By now, the world is far enough beyond Joseph Stalin to be able to watch Eisenstein's films as art.,positive;Movie
"Focus is another great movie starring William H. Macy. I first discovered Macy in Fargo and I've seen a few of his films and he hasn't yet deceived me. Macy is the archetypal ""nice guy with something to hide"". In Focus, he plays the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hard-working stiff, who harbours his handicapped mother at home. The scene is set after World War II, at the height of McCarthyism. Newman is the head of Human Resources for a company which is basically, anti-Semite. After he accidentally hires a woman of Jewish descent, he is asked to buy a pair of glasses, to improve his failing eyesight.<br /><br />Unbelievably, the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of Gertrude Hart, his wife (played by a great Laura Dern). As the film unravels, Newman will begin to see a whole different world, where being Jewish is akin to being an animal.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal. The chilling thought is that in some places, it probably still is.,positive";Movie
"In ""Brave New Girl,"" Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end (It seems a sequel could be in the making). Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.,positive";Movie
"Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. Clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi didn't direct it. Although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. It's too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. I don't think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the Pang Brothers.<br /><br />The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other ""horror"" films, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in ""The Messengers."" What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of ""Pulse,"" a couple that could have come from ""The Birds,"" one or two from ""The Others,"" etc. Nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the ""surprise ending"" long before it comes.<br /><br />Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. I'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn't there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling ""Boo!"" All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. If there's any message that ""The Messengers"" delivers, it's ""Don't waste your time on this movie."",negative";Movie
This movie sucks ass. Something about a heatwave in some European country, complete trash. There's nothing going for this movie whatsoever. maybe 30 seconds of sex but that's it. There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off. This movie is complete rash and you shouldn't subject yourself to watching it. I regret it it's very boring. I would rate it zero but i can't. No body in their right mind should see this. i'm sure you'll regret it completely i did. How could they think up something this bad. Even Mystery men was better. MYSTERY MEN. That sucks. That movie wasn't worth being made. complete waste of time. The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored.,negative;Movie
I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian features.<br /><br />It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.<br /><br />But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /><br />Darn you, ape man! Efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clichés, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.<br /><br />Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /><br />Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but had I paid I would've felt I had gotten my money's worth.,positive;Movie
"Going into see Seven Pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All of this comes to an end when the ""twist"",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to.<br /><br />The acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. Although the casting of the film was still good.<br /><br />This movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. Final thought seven pounds=seven Stars.,positive";Movie
I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The film follows Scott Cohen from parole in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives. Also, the imagery of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.,positive;Movie
"""Mararía"" really disappointed me. I can't consider it as a bad movie, but the development just seemed too rushed and non-believable for it to evoke any emotions. Dr. Fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can't really understand where it was born from. I mean, how many times does he ever have a conversation with Mararía?? Maybe once? Also, Mararía never appeared to be a real character, instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie (...or else another title was needed?). Some of the best acting came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, that of Marcial, the sub-intelligent yet humble drunkard. Of course, the scenery, the cultural tidbits of the Canary Islands, and other ""wow"" moments were interesting, but the movie fell short of a documentary (in case this was its real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.,negative";Movie
Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind. Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.,negative;Movie

It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman, he's much less comfortable.<br /><br />But his way with an epigram is peerless, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).<br /><br />The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: H&M themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).<br /><br />The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward.<br /><br />Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member.<br /><br />The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...,positive;Movie
"This is definitely a ""must see"" film. The excellent Director Alain Chabat (also acting as Ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the ""Adventures of Astérix"" (the French comic books it's based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) might not get all the ""private jokes"". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the French way of life, that the fun might be lessened. However, it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please don't EVER compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books : ""Astérix et Obélix Contre César"" and directed by Claude Zidi.,positive";Movie
I thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi).<br /><br />Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />Although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />Overall i thought this film was fantastic.,positive;Movie
"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number 1, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But ""Gentleman Jim"" is a lot more fun.,positive";Movie
"That this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that God is truly dead. Am I the only one that really saw (rather sleptwalked) through this ""film""? This is the only movie I've ever seen in the theater that I regret not walking out on and demanding my money back -- it was just that dull. And I even saw ""Highlander 2: The Quickening"" at the local cinema. From beginning to end, Gibson and Downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies, cast together by circumstance, who eventually work together as best buddies.

This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts, we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet T-shirt contests quite frequently, the story is just laughably idiotic, and the film takes itself much too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa?<br /><br />But it has a few things going for it. Bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.,negative;Movie
"Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we're all different, `Made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `Committed,' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story.<br /><br />	Admittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. When Joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. Maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. Regardless, she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him, which she does-- in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. She considers Carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen's `Grampy,' (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself.<br /><br />	There's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. We see it from Joline's point-of-view, as Krueger makes us privy to Joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. That, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. There's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.<br /><br />	Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation. She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable-- and Graham succeeds on all fronts. Her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. She's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life.<br /><br />	As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging, as well. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. She is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life.<br /><br />	Overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.<br /><br />	The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor), and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `Committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.,positive";Movie
Ho-hum. An inventor's(Horst Buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unknowingly his son(Luke Perry)has been working on the antedote all along. Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat-and-mouse car chases and gunfire begins. Also in the cast are:Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore. Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts. Perry fans will be accepting. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but nice to look at.,negative;Movie
"Note to self. Never ever ever again watch a serious movie with Charlie Sheen in it. Great comedian, horrible seal. This movie makes Navy SEALS look like a reckless group of rangers when, in fact, they are the most elite form of military in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the Navy SEAL reputation. Thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. This is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to wreck them with ""funny"" comments.,negative";Movie
This movie is stupid. There's no getting around it. But so is Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is significantly more funny than this. However, I for one love seeing stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. Call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.,negative;Movie
"I was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I've ever spent at the cinema.<br /><br />In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why I'm rating this a 4.<br /><br />In this version, Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as ""not just wicked, but vulgar."" <br /><br />There's also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me; Sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset. While the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, ""Oh puh-leeze.""<br /><br />About the only things true to the book were:<br /><br />1. Sara's father being a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father (""Are you learning me by heart?""/""No. I know you by heart. You are inside my heart."") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her 'adopting' Lottie (although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been) 4. The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that's about all that is.<br /><br />People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.<br /><br />If all you want is a 'feel-good' family film, then this delivers. If you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this one. It's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.<br /><br />Am I harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? Very probably. But if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.,negative";Movie
as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. TV told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we all made over $100 a day when $20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for NL $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos. i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll. instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all. i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside. anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs. im no longer homeless, am now in govt housing for $177 a month and getting SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI. glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping, worrying about getting caught by security are finally over. had this TV crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner. its a shame how they don't better select who they pick.,negative;Movie

Every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie. This movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be.<br /><br />The plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what's going on and you really want to view it for the second time. But after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be.<br /><br />A word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie. This is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie, in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b**bs and lots of blood.<br /><br />If you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation. And don't forget to switch the light off.<br /><br />My points on different aspects:-<br /><br />Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10<br /><br />Total = 9/10,positive;Movie
"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.<br /><br />18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. Isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he's sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the series' theme song, and manages to play ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"" so many times you might vomit. We get it, dude.<br /><br />Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls head over heels in love with Buck O'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly O'Neil waxes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense...<br /><br />Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. ""Baseball"" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There's no crying in baseball.,negative";Movie
"""Quitting"" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.<br /><br />But what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No clichés, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /><br />Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he's the ""cool"" actor, idolized by youth. ""He was hot in the early nineties."" ""He always had to be the most fashionable."" He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends--and roles, But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- ""I didn't know how to act"" ""I felt like a phony""--and to readily available drugs to counter them. He says ""I had to get high to do what director wanted."" So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /><br />Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic, but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. ""I started to open up"" he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. <br /><br />Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and TV, and bangs his head till bloody against his ""John Lennon Forever"" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his ""Mother Mary"" as an intercessor in his ""hour of darkness"" and ""time of trouble."" (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) ""Music is so much more real than acting"" he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as ""showing me a new way."" In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.<br /><br />If Lennon's influence is spiriting, Hongshen's father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It's this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: ""all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit."" And to Hongshen's emphatic ""you are NOT my father,"" he softly replies, ""why can't a peasant be your father?"" <br /><br />Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. ""You are just a human being"" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once ""rare and true friendships"" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: ""it's a good chance to think about my life."" And I might add, become a New Actor, one bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.,positive";Movie
I have watched this movie countless times, and never failed to be charmed by it's homely simplicity, sincerity and goodness. Great characterizations by all of the cast, and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role.I confess I fell in love with Roberta in 1970, and she still touches me today.

If only I had read the review by Alex Sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.<br /><br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU.<br /><br />Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldn't here.<br /><br />A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) I would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.<br /><br />An edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. Yes they're clever these director brothers whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC, Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.<br /><br />Guess what happens next? I won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-ridden universe.<br /><br />The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late. The Aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked alright. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. It's filmed and paced badly. It's acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.<br /><br />PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?,negative;Movie
Even though I saw this film when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who famously escaped from Newgate prison.<br /><br />Apart from the liberty taken right at the end, the film more or less faithfully follows the true story. The temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that.<br /><br />Of the performances, There is scarcely a poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good is Stanley Baker as the Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always.<br /><br />Because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family.,positive;Movie
Gone is the wonderful campiness of the original. In place is a c-grade action no-brainer, wich is not all bad, but pales in comparison to the original.

"Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.<br /><br />This being said, this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies. It's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere--except for Ealing Studios--which had a particular fondness for ""little"" films like this one.<br /><br />Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. He wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible, though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work! So, he tends to sneak into labs (either during the day if no one suspects or at night) and try his hand at inventing. Repeatedly, he is caught (such as after he blew up the lab) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds! Then, despite the importance of the discovery, he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events--and then the fun begins.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry, unions, the government and people in general.,positive";Movie
"Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history.<br /><br />I think we can all feel for ""Gypo"" because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong. This was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major American movie studio (RKO Radio Pictures).<br /><br />Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its very best here. However, August's stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn't receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved.<br /><br />This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible.,positive";Movie
"How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and ""B movie"" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.,negative";Movie
"The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It's peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.<br /><br />Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with Monica Gayle's screen presence, makes Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. The film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button.,positive";Movie

"Flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. Playing real-life boxing champ Jim Corbett, Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith. He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. The next day, he gets a chance, via Smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.) Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. He looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn. At this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. Bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn's manager. The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types. The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. A few of the sets are amazingly presented. Some of Smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. It's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. Some of it (like the character traits shown by Flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) One line is particularly memorable: ""I believe you like me more than I like you, but it's entirely possible that I love you more than you love me."" It's classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.),positive";Movie
"Often laugh out loud funny play on sex, family, and the classes in Beverly Hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it's seen since the days of Granny and Jed Clampett.

If Manuel wins, his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses, he must play bottom man to his friend! <br /><br />Lots of raunchy dialogue, fairly sick physical humour, etc. But a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface.

"Thought provoking, humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war. A small, but altruistic view of one family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This movie lessens the ""glamor"" of war; showing it's effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit.<br /><br />A lot of today's movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the ""hero's"" and other glamorous features of war, but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community. This movie attempts this through a retelling of a person's memory of those days. This movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events, when in reality, this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of ""actual events"" during the civil war. I highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie.,positive";Movie

I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl. The photography was beautiful.<br /><br />This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple as Grey Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I am not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave it the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes.,positive;Movie
"Despite having an absolutely horrid script (more about that later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. Aside from one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch just about anything with them in the film, as I am a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age of the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I just can't recommend this film.<br /><br />The movie begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort. The two haven't yet met, but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which Fonda horribly yodels while skiing. It was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but I stuck it out--especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling!! In hindsight, perhaps I should have just turned it off then! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help. Back at the ski lodge, he seems okay but fortunately she is ALSO a doctor and has him x-rayed and nurses him back to health. He, in turn, becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her. Despite hardly knowing each other, they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy.<br /><br />Once home, however, all isn't rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy. The film plays it all for laughs, but frankly Fonda's behaviors were really creepy--spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she treats, tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal away his wife. He comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it's all supposed to be for laughs. Considering that he seems like a dangerous nut, you would think that Stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order! But, oddly, she gets mad but just can't stay mad at Fonda because he's so........? I can't think of the right word--'creepy' is all that comes to mind!!! Later, out of the blue, multi-millionaire Fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past--so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions. When this job falls through, the film ends with Fonda buying his own hospital, giving Barbara a job there and they live happily ever after. They don't go any further with the story, but I assume based on Fonda's character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients.<br /><br />The first portion at the ski lodge and the next did NOT fit well together, nor did the final ""Horatio Alger"" inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world. They were like three separate plots but despite this, the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy! What a creepy little film! Thank goodness neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films.,negative";Movie
I find the critique of many IMDb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to GET AWAY from it all.<br /><br />In this case however I have to say it was BAD. I am a SciFi junkie and there was NOTHING in this movie that grabbed me for even one second.<br /><br />There was no proper storyline. I may be an idiot but I still do not know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so worried about these pieces.<br /><br />The pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these 3 pieces is scary. Half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third. A 3 year old kid would have been able to put them together.<br /><br />This movie was BAD.<br /><br />Dominic,negative;Movie
I was debating between this movie and 2012 but chose Inglourious Basterds due to it's amazingly high IMDb rating. I must say now, what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialog. I got a huge dosage of the former, but not nearly enough of the latter. I felt shortchanged. The ratio between violence to plot is very important and I think this movie gets it totally wrong. And the plot? It's that believable or really all that entertaining either. Save your time and money. I can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses.,negative;Movie
Bend it like Beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line. It is about a girl called Jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team. there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives. i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve. The song choices are really good, 'hush my child, just move on up...to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.' Anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review.

"Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz(Andie MacDowell)is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband Sid(John Tururro)is a little lacking in the emotions department. Unhappy with the new home situation, their sensitive son Steven(Nathan Watt)decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny(Michael Richards)and Melvin(Lou Cutell)until his mom is well. Steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle's living habits; he even decides he wants to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 60's, this drama is a bit comedic...change that to zany. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; albeit I enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste.,negative";Movie
Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg...<br /><br />Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title. 'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?' he asks Andrews. 'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.'<br /><br />Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...<br /><br />By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...<br /><br />Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...<br /><br />The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best... <br /><br />Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...,positive;Movie
In sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! The director and co-writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. Well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. Additionally, the film is not really realistic. Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals. I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex-lover's son. By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex-lover. At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora. To the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael, her ex-lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub-plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball's chance in hell. The actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.,negative;Movie
"Incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all Roman emperors who went insane, leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path... I know there are several versions of this, and this is based on the 102 min' one that I watched - but I can't fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck!<br /><br />I'd heard for long about the alleged ""shocking"" content of sex/nudity (which honestly there isn't much of here at all - and boring when there is) and blood, but beware - it's the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here: Everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project! Camera-work is hopelessly inept, full of strange zooms, failed framing and confusing pans (to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage!) complete with a grainy, cheapish photo quality. Lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven - is it day or night? Are they in- or outside? Have they changed scenes? Who is, or is meant to be in the shot? Editing is the final sin here, making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways, continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum, story progression - and involvement. There is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story... but these faults distract so much it's tragic.<br /><br />A story with SO many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan, burnt (and Fellini-like) turkey that's only good for a few gobble-laughs and Peter O'Toole, who makes a most memorable Tiberius. Oh yes, which brings us to the big-name actors. I'd like to line them all up one by one and just ask: Who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this? There, I've wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time - period!<br /><br />1 out of 10 from Ozjeppe,negative";Movie
Did anyone edit this film? Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? It's OK though, I fell asleep watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I've seen either...but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life! Not trying to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used some more production.<br /><br />Please don't think I'm a hater of horror films, or even that I didn't enjoy this film. I just felt I was laughing at the film much more than I felt I was laughing along with it. The gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.<br /><br />Characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding this movie.<br /><br />1/10,negative;Movie
"Riding high on the success of ""Rebel Without a Cause"", came a tidal wave of 'teen' movies. Arguably this is one of the best. A very young McArthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen. The story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency, than any traumatic occurrence. The supporting cast is memorable, Frankenheimer directs like an old pro. Just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously.,positive";Movie
Most of the comments on this movie are positive so I thought I would try and redress the balance. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. I now know and still consider it to be a poor movie. I intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free ticket to the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Movie reviewers and critics love this movie, which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film. The 8+ rating this movie has is so misleading. In 20 years time this film will not compare to true greats such as The Godfather. The film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn't enough to save the film. (nor are the lesbian scenes!),negative;Movie
Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all. For le Moko, although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.<br /><br />Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I'll mention two. First was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the Casbah. That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly. So, neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. I understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.<br /><br />This is worth watching for Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10,negative;Movie
"Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn't a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don't make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William's body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, ""What are you looking at?!"" The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard ""bumbling assistant"" role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that he's writing his own films, you'd think he'd give himself a role that he hasn't been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.,positive";Movie
You should never ever even consider to watch this movie! It is absolutely awful! This isn't an overstatement!! It is so unbelievable and exaggerated, it gets boring. It is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one. They writer hasn't been able to pull it off in a good way.<br /><br />If you'd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you, but still, you should plug your ears and just watch. It's not worth listening:p There are so many great movies out there, and if I could choose one, this would be the last movie I would pick. But all in all, it's your choice!!! <br /><br />Enjoy!,negative;Movie
Tell the truth I’m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to see this movie. And after having seen it, I was really a disappointed, and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie.<br /><br />I’m surprise at this movie all completely – it is like a kid’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing. I’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account.<br /><br />Synopsis: The story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior. There they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak.<br /><br />Just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all. They are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected) and the humor is lame. And haven’t we already seen the same characters (play by Mc Lovin’) in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep.<br /><br />Well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay. And the acting is so-so as expected when you’re watching this type of movie. And the direction, what do one expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie.<br /><br />Anyway I felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie. Can’t really see any point why I should recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Pros: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes.<br /><br />Cons: Not funny, dreadful story, nudity and kids do not mix together.<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/10 (Grade: F),negative;Movie
This film held my interest enough to watch it several times. The plot has holes, but the lead performers make it work.<br /><br />Catherine Mary Stewart (Julia Kerbridge), does a great job as a woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician. She worked years to earn the money to go to medical school. She is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Julia's sister and brother-in-law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece Amanda (Arlen Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid having her become a ward of the state. Amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance. Amanda is so traumatized from her parent's murder that she has become mute. Needless to say, Julia's 16-hour days get longer caring for Amanda.<br /><br />Rob Lowe plays Kevin Finney, a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of Julia and Amanda. He is always there with a trick or a joke to help Amanda deal with her distress. Amanda really starts to warm up to Kevin as the film progresses, perhaps more than to her aunt. Julia starts to rely on Kevin to take some of the load of caring for Amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination. Kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for Julia.<br /><br />The chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. You keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film. The chemistry between Rob and Arlen was good as well. Arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words. The plot had Julia and Amanda gradually warming up to each other. You can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses.<br /><br />We discover that Julia's sister and brother-in-law (the Meyers) were involved in industrial espionage. They stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft. Julia discovers that the Meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities. The plot is unclear whether the Meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed.<br /><br />In any case the Meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates. The killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the Meyers before killing them. The killers search the home and fail to find their prize. They leave a living witness to their crime, Amanda. The killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from Julia and Amanda who have no idea where the prize is located. Eventually, the killers kidnap Amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip's location.<br /><br />Eventually Julia discovers the truth about Kevin. He is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip. After some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue Amanda and dispatch the bad guys. The predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together.<br /><br />What struck me about the plot were major holes. Kevin moves into the same apartment building as Julia and Amanda the day after the murder of the Meyers. How does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers? The killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene, with no concern for concealing their identity. The killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to Amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles. He was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film. There are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention.<br /><br />The film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming. Filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort.,positive;Movie
"Like the previous poster, I am from northern Vermont, and I was inclined to like this film. However, not since ""Red Zone Cuba"" have I seen such a confusing plot. The things the people to bootleg make no sense. Two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car. Uhm, why? Then they meet two others, and drive up at night in to the bad guy's hideout in a luxury Packard. --Wouldn't just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense? Then, parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, the four fall asleep! When they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out, of course they're spotted and shot at, losing some of their precious cargo in the process. Then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border. Again, why? I am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area, all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the U.S. Canada Border Patrol, which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now. <br /><br />And don't get me started on the last half hour, which made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about the film is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years.,negative";Movie
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. This movie was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even watch it all it was so bad. This film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot. This was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times. Not even the gore in the film was good. The shootings were fake and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. If you see it at the rental store then run the other way. There is nothing good about this film at all. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch Night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head. If you want to see an OK new cheesy movie then watch Scarecrow. I rate this movie a 0.2 out of 10. That's how horrible this film really is. THE WORST MOVIE EVER.,negative;Movie
"Watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line, the excellent character development, and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole.<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot, it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /><br />The story has a prologue about what dancing in Japan symbolizes sociologically, so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in Japan as it is here in the U.S. <br /><br />The film is lighthearted; you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags. Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe. All of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their ""imperfections.""<br /><br />I've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends. It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance. Is this synchronous or what? I think so because now I'm really geeked to give it a try. <br /><br />Watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again.<br /><br />Why they would make a remake of Shall We Dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as-is.,positive";Movie
"Recap: Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica. The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica. Julian Rome, a former SETI-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. Soon the object is in the open. The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. It is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, Julian decodes the signal. ""Do not open"". But too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. The first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. And Washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. So a Russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.<br /><br />Comments: The movie holds a few surprises. One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. It is never really explained why Washington know so much, why Washington is able to command Russian submarines, why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now. It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English. Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose English, why?). But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus, send their ""Do not open"" message encoded! And finally the end is as open as an end can be.<br /><br />The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.<br /><br />3/10,negative";Movie

"Had I checked IMDb BEFORE renting this DVD from Netflix, I'd have a couple of hours of my life back. I'm frankly suspicious when I see that a film's director also wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same guy was ""writter and director"" - unfortunately, an indication of the overall quality of this production. There were a few interesting moments (e.g., Judy Tenuta's scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting Judy-ism) which led me to rate this two stars rather than one. Those moments, however, were few and far between ... and I almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me, not to mention reprehensible in its violence. I admit I went back to watch that part again to see if I had missed something that would help me figure it out once I'd seen the whole thing. Nope, though I at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later. The ""spinning camera"" technique was overused and essentially pointless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: ""What?!?"" or ""For goodness sake, get ON with it!"" Not recommended.,negative";Movie
The endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me. This truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and enraging. As an American, I am constantly humiliated by my country's behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I've seen, but it immediately made me want to see what else he's done. My only complaint, and the reason I gave this film only 8 out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the US and UK governments, demands that we viewers/citizens are complicit in our own inaction...but makes no suggestion of how to help. I don't know about Britain, but America's made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government's doings. A gesture in the right direction might help these islanders' cause.,positive;Movie
This flick is so bad its beyond belief.Even for an independent low budget film...it just, well, sucks.I can't even believe even Troma would put out such crap.I have been a fan of some Troma flicks for years(Toxic Avenger,Squeeze Play,Rockabilly Vampire to name a few).But LLoyd, come on,this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste.It features some of the worst acting imaginable.I think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good...oh,wait, that is what they did.I mean it,these characters have negative charisma.With any luck, the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity.As will the special effects people.But beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects,the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears.The script is full of plot holes the size of Alaska, and there are severe continuity problems.The worst part however, is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way.And this is the most unforgivable sin in film making.But, don't take my word for it.Go out and waste four bucks renting it.Just don't say I didn't warn you.,negative;Movie
This is a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /><br />All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.,positive;Movie
"The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. He discovers Molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. He signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films such as, Singin' in the Rain(1952) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic(1969). What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. But the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's film legacy. It doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a ""positive"" reworking of Mack Sennett's and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael ""Linnett"" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course is Mabel. Sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and Keystone Cops. He worked with Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin(cameo), Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle(body double) and fell in love with his leading lady. Not only all that, but Sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. As most film viewers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture. As Mack Sennett fell into that category, it is fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career started in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director & producer. He semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit. He had worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers(in Way Up Thar).As film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career, Mack played it wise & did only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category, and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940's his presence was still felt, e.g. Here Come the Co-Eds(1945)where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in Mack's Wandering Willies(1926)is done. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood, used some of Sennett's Crosby films. 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With his knack of always associating with the right people, a guest role with the eternally popular Lawrence Welk & his radio show came about later in the year. 1950 brought a re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance(1914) with sound. In 1952 he was honored on TV's, This Is Your Life, then his autobiography, The King of Comedy(1954), which is a great companion piece to Hollywood Cavalcade, was published. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, as he had a cameo in A&C Meet the Keystone Kops. Finally in 1957, another tribute with the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So when you watch Hollywood Cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer. In the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table. As we get to the silver haired Mack, he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say, ""here I am!"". When he rises to give a speech a short while later, he is at his most subdued, underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey, ""I know my influence on comedy will never end, but will people forget Mack Sennett the individual. Maybe this movie will help."",positive";Movie
It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.<br /><br />Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today.<br /><br />But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.<br /><br />The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br /><br />Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe.<br /><br />This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /><br />When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.<br /><br />So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.<br /><br />And if they weren't real, they should have been.,positive;Movie
"Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy, what a terrible film. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the ""director's cut"", or in this case, ""let's salvage whatever we can"" from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment ""I'll give you three guesses"" was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned ""raunchy"" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another ""wink"" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her ""uncle"" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like ""what happened here?""<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her ""uncle"" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The ""Girl in no man's land"" is OK even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.,negative";Movie
"This series, made for Televisión Española (TVE) is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son.<br /><br />Based on a background of historical events, such as the May 1968 student uprising in France, the decaying Franco regime, the war in Viet-Nam, the rise of imperialism, and others specifically related to Spanish life at that particular moment, one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment.<br /><br />Generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic, the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times, as, it should be stated, anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things.<br /><br />The best thing that can be said of this series is Ana Duato's rôle as mother of three children: she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well, manifesting that peculiar Spanish penchant, especially noticeable among women, of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart, without any resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little, apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series. Indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything which is not a TV series. His resources are too limited; however, his part as father of the working-class household is not at all bad.<br /><br />Not really recommendable for other audiences, even Spanish-speakers in Latin America: the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary Spanish history, such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references. It is even probable that certain situations which cause a few Spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers.,negative";Movie
I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrific! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them the same again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they never could act. Thankfully, only Dan attempted an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read.,negative;Movie
One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. However, it is seldom every seen on cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.,positive;Movie
It's nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead, this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little cliché you cant help but like it.<br /><br />I think the story was a little rushed at the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with Mr arrogant, and possibly tied with my tutor friend.<br /><br />It would make an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as great as My sassy girl, but still good.,positive;Movie
"Of all the movies of the seventies, none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like the Exorcist, and other ones; but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, check this one out. You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the books are really good as well. I'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. It's so scary that it would outdo this movie.,positive";Movie
"This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is ""Tom Brown"" and his main rival, ""Bob"" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford--always remembered as the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clichés are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />In my opinion, for a better silent college film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others)--and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. Well made, but certainly NOT original! And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920!! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess.,positive";Movie
"This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.<br /><br />Awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a let down in practically every other way.<br /><br />An ""adaptation"" of sorts, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, setting it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.<br /><br />And that's what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. It's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. Except with guns and in different outfits.<br /><br />Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which I completely tuned out, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go.<br /><br />I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.<br /><br />A shame. An absolute shame.,negative";Movie
"Owen loves his Mamma...only he'd love her better six feet under in this dark, laugh-out-loud comedy that both stars and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role.<br /><br />""Throw Momma From The Train"" is a terrific comedy, even if it isn't a great film. It's too shallow in parts, and the ending feels less organic than tacked on. But it's a gut-splitting ride most of the way, with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer (DeVito is avid but untalented; Crystal is blocked and bitter).<br /><br />Crystal's Professor Donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunately titled ""Hot Fire"") and can't write more than the opening line of his next book, which doesn't come easy. He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-type fiction but doesn't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through; and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs-per-minutes-on-screen, an ascot-wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: ""100 Girls I'd Like To Pork.""<br /><br />Then there's DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's ""star pupil"" even though the teacher won't read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a man-child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him ""lardass"" and other endearing sentiments. In any other movie, we'd be asked to feel sorry for Owen, but ""Throw Momma From The Train"" piles life's cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along. That's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people.<br /><br />For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and take the rest of what we see here as a lark, it's not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes, asking us to watch in amusement while Owen enlists Professor Donner's help in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, then tells the professor it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, ""swapping murders"" as seen in Hitchcock's ""Strangers On A Train.""<br /><br />As a director, DeVito not only complements his actors' performances with scene-setting that places the accent on dialogue, he makes some bold visual statements, throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes (and away from taking things too seriously.)<br /><br />Also helping matters is writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter. ""You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here."" ""She's not a woman...She's the Terminator."" ""One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper."" Those are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context but absolutely kill, are DeVito's and Ramsey's. Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this, according to the IMDb, and that's a shame, because he had real talent for it.<br /><br />The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical 'coming attraction' presentation, the only time I've seen a movie promoted that way. Owen introduces the professor to his mother as 'Cousin Patty,' and when Momma says he doesn't have a Cousin Patty, panicky Owen loses it. 'You lied to me,' he yells out, slamming the professor's forehead with a pan.<br /><br />Of course, in reality the professor wouldn't groan out something witty from the floor, but 'Throw Momma From The Train' works effectively at such moments, when playing its Looney Tunes vibe for all its worth. DeVito hasn't disappeared from films, of course, but it's a mystery why he hasn't really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie. Maybe it's because, as 'Throw Momma From The Train's lack of mainstream success shows, his kind of vision isn't to everyone's tastes. That's too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over, and like it.,positive";Movie

"Filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves.<br /><br />This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent). The premise, about people who's lives are going nowhere, who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs, COULD have made for a really funny, insightful, quirky, cultish film. Instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits I'm suprised it hasn't been banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y sleeps with Z as well. Oh you figure it out.<br /><br />A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it.<br /><br />If you're the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on Saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it ""a right laff"". Everyone else, run, don't walk away from this sorry little misfit.<br /><br />And one question, when the group left the ""boring"" seaside town (Saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film), to go back to Glasgow, WHY did they do it via the Forton motorway services at LANCASTER which is in England?,negative";Movie
Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, but is totally worthwhile. It really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s. Which is why I'd have loved to see follow-up movies... but judging by the rest of Full Moon's output there simply weren't enough tits to satisfy the typical audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience - which is unfortunate, because without em' this could have been a Harry Potter-style magicfest that kids would have eaten up. Both Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are great - I wasn't sure if Ms. Nipar hadn't wandered off an A-list picture onto this film, she was very believable. No, seriously!

"It doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.<br /><br />George Crile's 2003 best seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely ""difference maker"" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, ""Good Time Charlie"" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. It's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels.<br /><br />When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, ""You can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits."" No argument there.<br /><br />But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh?<br /><br />Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising ""Charlie's Team.""<br /><br />The on-screen ""Team,"" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the ""Team,"" Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score -- both in the Agency's boardroom and in Wilson's bedroom.<br /><br />For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money, lots of money, and eventually ""Charlie's Team"" covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty stuff.<br /><br />That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma, I wish it weren't so...<br /><br />Even though the initial outcome for ""Team Charlie"" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely ""covert,"" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to ""Mission Accomplished.""<br /><br />As Nichol's film so pointedly points out, ""The ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it."" Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn't. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols film).<br /><br />Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best, ""We f&%ked up the end game.""<br /><br />Again.,positive";Movie
"I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.<br /><br />If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church's fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.<br /><br />There are a few moments where you might cry, ""Aha! surrealism!"": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in B/W). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm...). If you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.,negative";Movie
"This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.,negative";Movie
This film was pretty good. I am not too big a fan of baseball, but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc.<br /><br />Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza, and Milton Davis Jr. are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was believable, and I love the message. William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.<br /><br />Most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often do not work well. But this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale, even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there.<br /><br />10/10,positive;Movie
For his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. In the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. The ending is superb.

Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. Also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All of this, so far, is accurate. But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it.<br /><br />This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate. There may be some truth to that, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hour-long episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.,negative;Movie
I was truly looking forward to this title. It sounded and looked fun. The idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs, but instead this title only bores. First off, there is almost no Froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit through 75+ minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the Froggg humping a bare breasted chick. Why? On top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot. I mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. I wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue (Creature from the Black Lagoon stuff), I wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the Froggg going on a killing spree, or it maybe escaping a silly trap. Something exciting! Geez, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick? My advice to the filmmakers: Keep going, your concepts are good, but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired. Have some fun with the creature, put the humor in the action and most important...put more creature in a creature movie!!!,negative;Movie
One of my sisters friends lent me this game, and it is too damn hard! It carries the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions, and you have to search seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your 'score'! You also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UP TO STAGE THREE!!!!!

"Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit Seasoning', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I would have to concede that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most finely honed script. Here, the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costello's 'Who's on next' routine. As a long term Daffy fan, I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous ""Pronoun trouble"" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration ""You're despicable"". As intricate an example of Chuck Jones's impeccable timing as you'll come across, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.,positive";Movie
A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear.

"""Crossfire"" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene, and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels winds up dead.<br /><br />I don't know about 1947, but seeing ""Crossfire"" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-Semite language.<br /><br />The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />Truly excellent, and a must see.,positive";Movie
AWWWW, I just love this movie to bits. Me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and I am just such a HUGE FAN!!! I hope they bring the TV series out on DVD soon.

"Skippy from ""Family Ties"" plays Eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who gets picked on. When his favorite wussy 'metal' singer, Sammi Curr, dies, he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge, but then he doesn't want to take it as far as Sammi does. Which isn't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital. This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say, ""Rock Star"". OK, maybe a tad more than that piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from ""Family Ties"" I haven't a clue. The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency, I applaud him for that, but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />Eye Candy:Elise Richards gets topless, an a topless extra at a pool party,negative";Movie
"Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy. He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing. So Rodolfo Sonego did. If you check out his biography, you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town, in 1968 to check out locations for ""A girl in Australia"" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war. You can see his humor in all his movies. I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently. GREAT,positive";Movie
"Goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in VG history. Their is no doubt about that. But this game, although quite different, could quite possibly be the modern-day Bond champ, of its time.<br /><br />This was not a bond game based on material from another medium. This was a completely new; scripted game. Which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) Gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. Which gives it that more cinematic feel. With a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.<br /><br />Enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish. Even after beating the game there's still plenty more to be done. With the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a stand-out game. Despite being quite old now, in video game years. It's still a good game that you can pick up & play whenever you feel the need to get a little more Bond in your life. Even now just thinking about it, I've got the theme song stuck in my head. Such a great cast and well-written storyline.<br /><br />The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were their in front of you, and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself. Superbly done, in true bond fashion. Which can only be named Awesome, Completely Awesome.<br /><br />I've gotta go throw this game on now. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out!,positive";Movie

"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a ""thumbs in the middle"" review, remarking that I'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br /><br />Everything's wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />And for God's sake...is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see ""no character development"", above).<br /><br />And to make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1) Joker gasses people.<br /><br />2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3) Batman saves the day.<br /><br />Pfeh.<br /><br />There was one episode I saw that wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the ""Think Thank Thunk"" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than ""I've Got Batman in My Basement."" <br /><br />I can't really say what I feel this show is because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with ""B"" and rhymes with ""fastardization"". Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days.

"Just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid. If your child likes this film you'd better have him/her tested. I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad. This ""film"" is a showcase for digital wizardry AND NOTHING ELSE. The writing is horrid. I can't remember when I've heard such bad dialogue. The songs are beyond wretched. The acting is sub-par but then the actors were not given much. Who decided to employ Joey Fatone? He cannot sing and he is ugly as sin.<br /><br />The worst thing is the obviousness of it all. It is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible. Great children's movies are wicked, smart and full of wit - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past.

"""Hey Babu Riba"" is a film about a young woman, Mariana (nicknamed ""Esther"" after a famous American movie star), and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha, and Pop, all perhaps 15-17 years old in 1953 Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The five are committed friends and crazy about jazz, blue jeans, or anything American it seems.<br /><br />The very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant, and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties. In the wake of changing communist politics, they go their separate ways and reunite in 1985 (the year before the film was made).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film with some reservations. The subtitles for one thing were difficult. Especially in the beginning, there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all. Perhaps the conversational pace required it, but I couldn't always both read the text and absorb the scene, which caused me to not always understand which character was involved. I watched the movie (a video from our public library) with a friend, and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative.<br /><br />This Yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers' sense of invulnerability, idealism, and strong and loyal bonds to each other. There is a main flashforward, and it was intriguing, keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis-a-vis the 1953 cast, and what had actually happened.<br /><br />I would rate it 7 out of 10, and would like to see other films by the director, Jovan Acin (1941-1991).,positive";Movie

Along the night, without any communication with his base, Jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients, and finds some corpses, indicating that among them there is a killer.<br /><br />""The Last Stop"" could be an average thriller, but the screenplay is simply awful. Most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed, and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Encurralados"" (""Trapped""),negative";Movie
This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Murphy's Law being applied to home ownership and construction. If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional. Since it was set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment, 7/10.,positive;Movie
"What can you say about the film White Fire. Amazing? Fantastic? Disturbing? Hilarious? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire. From wobbly, garbled beginning to profound end, this movie will entertain throughout.<br /><br />Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world. A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms. When the father separates from the mother and their childen, you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch. Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit, and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them, but alas, dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised, unsafe stunt. Meanwhile, mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them. He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre ""HALT!"", and then promptly wastes the mother. This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.<br /><br />So now we fast forward about 20 years (30 if you're honest about the hero's age) to beautiful Turkey, where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves, or diamond prospectors, or something. Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods, while Bo (masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty) drives around the desert in his denim outfits. Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship. They don't seem to have any friends other than each other, and they spend all of their time together. That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as ""you know its a shame you're my sister"" he says to her while she's stark naked, make for a very dynamic duo. Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed, as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf. A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid, and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid. This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong. Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas, and he is overjoyed with his new love.<br /><br />So anyway, there's a lot of fun action scenes, ridiculous violence, great acting, impossible to follow plot-lines, Fred ""the hammer"" Williamson (for some reason), and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond (which later explodes). All of these things are great, but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special....really special. So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire. You may be glad you did..or not.,positive";Movie
I am so disappointed. This movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy. Here was the quintessential Woody Allen film all over again: the neurotic upper-class Manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses. Woody, I've seen these characters already, I've seen the storyline from you ten times already. Where did your creativity go??? You need to open your eyes and look around you. The world has changed dramatically since Annie Hall - and you need to change along with it.<br /><br />There are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again.<br /><br />When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now I've come to expect his old standby: the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating. Depressing and same old, same old.<br /><br />If Woody wants to win his fans back, then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated - not insulted.,negative;Movie
"This movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. As a Don Knotts vehicle, ""The Incredible Mr. Limpet"" was much better, with Knott's character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. His performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as Bob Denver did. Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. It was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. John Ritter, whom Knotts worked with in ""Three's Company,"" was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like ""The Dreamer of Oz,"" but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in ""Pleasantville."" Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in ""Airplane!"" and ""Police Squad.""<br /><br />There's also no way the then-43 year-old Knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the college-age Forrest Gump.<br /><br />The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed TV episode. It's especially evident in the ""exterior"" scenes of the ""town"" where Roy goes after he's fired. It's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the Mayberry-like soundstage artificiality.<br /><br />Even viewing this strictly as a children's movie, it's very disappointing. It's not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. The pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). Movies, even kid's movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. Disney's ""The Love Bug,"" for instance, at least had some interesting race action.,negative";Movie
"If you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called ""Outlaw Seas"" or ""The Outlaw Sea"", and it describes, in story after story, how these things do happen. The lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons. One, many of the world's freighters are of questionable registry (nationality) and it's difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don't have an office in a real country. Two, many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries. The crews are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officers and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once committing an illegal act, the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint. Anyway, it's fascinating reading.<br /><br />Horrifying story, excellent movie. Does anyone else notice how HBO seems to make the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble releasing enough Oscar worthy movies in any given year, so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema.<br /><br />I loved the thoroughly evil performance by Sean Pertwee. I also, as usual, loved Omar Epps.,positive";Movie

You will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but in short, Gamers: DR is a must watch movie for RPG lovers. For people never play RPG game, I'm sure you still get many fun from it.,positive";Movie
In all honesty, I haven't seen this film for many years, but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties, and it scared the hell out of us kids, in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can't risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler, followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history, and yet oddly moving, in a way. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.,negative;Movie
"This is the only thing I will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that rocked. It rocked hard, and yet it also rocked tasty. Mr.MEATLOAF added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled. Now that tells you something, this filmed rocked even before it STARTED! Now I don't want to give to much away or be a ""spoiler"" but this movie ROCKED! If you have heard the new album and thought to yourself ""this seems a bit substandard Tenacious material,it is like I a merely playing badminton with Satan, what gives?"" Then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who would want it better do not know what they want,because better would no longer be the D. This movie is the D period.!So venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked.,positive";Movie
You'd think you're in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, going through most of Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.<br /><br />Reda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can't drive, and therefore enlists the help of Reda, to his son's protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle.<br /><br />But Reda doesn't see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. And hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals.<br /><br />The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences.<br /><br />It's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.<br /><br />It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don't miss this, and yes, book early - I was pleasantly surprised that this evening's session was still a full house.,positive;Movie
"I watched this movie based on the good reviews here, and I won't make that mistake again.<br /><br />The first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. Flashback 12-hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people, which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen. When the ending is finally reveled, you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn't happen and means nothing to what you have been watching. The only connection these people have is that they have all had a ""bad day""--but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom.<br /><br />If this was supposed to be a ""Crash"" clone, it's a complete failure.,negative";Movie
A great Bugs Bunny cartoon from the earlier years has Bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store. After he's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he'll be transferring soon. Bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy...and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals. Animals like say, a certain rabbit. This causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer. I found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940's. It still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later. This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.<br /><br />My Grade: A-,positive;Movie
"I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /><br />1 ) Host Steve Martin was at his most wittiest: "" I saw the teamsters help Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo "" and "" I'll better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed "" <br /><br />2 ) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody down for best actor ( Genuine applause ) or Roman Polanski for best director ( Genuine jeers and boos ) but they won <br /><br />Last year's award ceremony wasn't too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even if it wasn't the best in the trilogy ( FELLOWSHIP was much better )but what let the BBC coverage down was Jonathan Ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but . So when I heard Sky were doing the coverage for British TV I was expecting Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be doing the links , but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne ! Oh gawd if British TV are desperate for film critics ( Obviously they are ) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly over to LA to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers <br /><br />Chris Rock wasn't too bad , but he's no Steve Martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in ! Not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion . The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "" minor "" Oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats ! There's no such thing as a "" minor "" Oscar and just because the award is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design they're as well deserved as Best Picture or Best Director . All the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium . What a bunch of arrogant snobs the Academy are becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history . As for the awards themselves <br /><br />Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett . No great surprise for a competitive category <br /><br />Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman . No real complaints since Freeman is one of America's greatest living character actors <br /><br />Best Actor - Jamie Foxx . Most predictable award of the night . Yawn <br /><br />Best Actress - Hilary Swank . Major surprise since everyone thought Annette Benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but Swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night <br /><br />Best Director - Clint Eastwood . Major surprise since everyone thought Scorsese was going to get the award simply because he'd never won one . Actually I'm glad about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /><br />Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR BABY . Again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while I thought the Hollywood friendly plot of THE AVIATOR would have made it a dead cert for Best Picture while MDB's controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off <br /><br />What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore Oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven't done in the past , I mean A BEAUTIFUL MIND beating THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING for gawd's sake ! And long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts,negative";Movie
"While in a plane, flicking through the large choice of movies, I came across Live! almost accidentally. oh boy! what a choice.<br /><br />I remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride. I don't remember last time I have been so excited, terrified. Not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses, but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can't turn away from the screen, literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you've got.<br /><br />You will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show. You will drift from thinking ""how come the human being can be so vicious"" to ""why not after all?"".Ask yourself would you do it. Then learn about the contestants, their motives and start guessing. You will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe.<br /><br />Good acting, good directing, with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more.<br /><br />*Spoilers* couple of things i would have changed:<br /><br />- the casting of the contestants. i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him. The idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it felt like you didn't care about some of the contestants. Although this might have been done on purpose, i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants. - game rules, a big glitch :<br /><br />what happens if the 5th contestants doesn't die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself!!! they should have given a chance to all contestants to live, ie: if 5th is a blank too, then no one dies.<br /><br />interestingly I haven't been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time. just wish i had some popcorn with me!,positive";Movie
"Ah, another movie with motorcycles, hell's angels posse and Steve A-Lame-o as the not-so-cool car driver.

Bike chick Linda (rrrr) makes out with everyone! Fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds. I also dare you to try to make out what Banjo is saying.

I feel dumber after watching the first 20 min,luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly,not because of the budget of the film or the special effects, just simply good acting and getting simple things right,and MOst importantly--not being LAME--, but i guess this was produced for those Sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is ''A good Movie''don't be scared of rating films low,save your under-appreciated high scores for ''once in a life time movies''.

This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Nielson in. This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny. I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Nielson to be funny. He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual. But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he isn't. The movie had only one good part, and this may be considered a spoiler by some, and that the beginning credits were animated. If the whole movie had been animated, it might have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads for it, and the only reason I did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest. This is the first and probably only movie I have ever walked out on. On a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a score of -100.,negative;Movie
"I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. Now I've see many of them. As special efx have a ever more grip on todays films, some times to find a real gem , you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare , pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called "" The New House "" was one of the most scariest films I ever saw. It was on once in 1972,...I was only 9,..but nothing since then even compared to it. With all the remake going on in Hollywood, some one should do this one "" as is "" with no more special efx than the original. This episode was down right creepy as hell. I'm lucky to find it finally on DVD today and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories to even come close was the ORIGINAL "" The Haunting "" and George C. Scott in "" The Changling "" . Wish someone would do more ghost stories like these.,positive";Movie
"Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, I have researched it heavily on the net, I have asked several people on there opinions. I have even gone to the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book that this movie is supposed to be based on. I feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it. As the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make any sense at all, here is the plot of the book.<br /><br />Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her Father, Mr De Lafontaine. They carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they get a letter from the 'General' a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death. He makes claims of supernatural powers being at work, and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the Lafontaines looking after her Daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has she to do with Laura's condition, and the General?<br /><br />I have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it, and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name, and would have a jingle too, but I can't be bothered with that. It's called the ""this movie doesn't make any sense"" game.<br /><br />All you have to do is, whilst watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete.<br /><br />It will have to answer such questions as ... <br /><br />* Why can vampires walk around in day light?<br /><br />* Why are they all lesbians?<br /><br />* Why is a girl called Bob? and why does she shoot herself?<br /><br />* When is the movie a dream and when is it real?<br /><br />* Why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn't make anyone bat an eyelid?<br /><br />* Why does Travis Fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car, yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too?<br /><br />* And why does he then let a girl, which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire, drive with him in his car?<br /><br />* And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car?<br /><br />What the hell is the asylum scene all about?<br /><br />* What the hell is the green goo all about?<br /><br />* Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse?<br /><br />* Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies?<br /><br />* What is the significance of the necklace? what is it made of? why does it kill vampires? and how does Jenna know that?<br /><br />In fact sod it, it's just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too.<br /><br />I have my plot, and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is a pretty good effort.<br /><br />In Conclusion<br /><br />'Vampires vs Zombies' has no moment in it where there are actually Vampires fighting Zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?,negative";Movie
"This would've been a *great* silent film. The acting really is good, at least in a Look Ma, I'm Doing Really Big Acting! sort of way.<br /><br />Everything is HUGE. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly, I felt like gagging. Yet, like any train wreck, I couldn't tear my eyes away. This dialogue might've worked on the stage, although I doubt it. On the screen, it was cluttered, haphazard, hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, heaping doses, you *might* enjoy the movie. Be prepared to wait, however. For all that melodrama, this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves. It simply doesn't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice, at times, when it uses its goofy computer-controlled ""weighted score"". Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it isn't character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is *not* character development. That's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie. Or at the very least, watch it muted. Perhaps you'll get some amusement from all the arm-waving the characters do.<br /><br />Oh, and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film, you see James Woods in all his dangly male ""look-at-me, I'm-the-figurative-and-literal-representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of- man"" glory.<br /><br />Don't say you weren't warned.,negative";Movie
"This movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward, attended by two orderlies. The unconscious main character is heard in a voice over, saying that the orderlies are gay. The orderlies kiss. I watched this in a DVD version and I have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny  it said comedy"" on the DVD case, after all and it goes on like that. Had I seen this in a movie theater I probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter, because it is so funny  and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy. While it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn't, this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn't.<br /><br />Brilliant brains can MAKE anything funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have proved that fact. But you have to know the mechanics"", I suppose. Director and co-scriptwriter Dani Levy does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example. Do not get me wrong, some people can MAKE that funny, Dani Levy can't, not for me, anyway.<br /><br />The main problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave. I could not understand why the two brothers, one an orthodox Jew from West Germany one a third class carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany so strongly disliked each other. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships  if anything they are embarrassing - just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better.<br /><br />The acting is not bad, Udo Semel I actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor Helmut Kohl (a lighter version) than of a venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction in itself is not really bad either, but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies, leaving the scriptwriting to someone else. Now I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!,negative";Movie
This story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is the mother of Muriël. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change her life in Brussels. Martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl. In fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something - for instances an accident - which could dramatize this story. As times goes on, you discover that the director Dorothée Van Den Berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more. This movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.,negative;Movie
First and foremost, I loved the novel by Ray Bradbury. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I as just hoping that this movie would be all right. It had lots of chances, with a great cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. And on top of all that, it has PAM GRIER!<br /><br />How could it fail?<br /><br />There may be spoilers within.<br /><br />First of all, it was dumbed down. Much of the horror from the book was lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. All the visuals from the book...gone. Everything that made you squirm...gone.<br /><br />And then there's the acting. Like a lot of movies that Disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. And, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship wasn't addressed. It was more like they were acquaintaces. <br /><br />You'd think Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could pull this off in their roles of Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it's like they just don't care. All they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /><br />Pam Grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the Dust Witch herself wasn't well pulled off. She's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book. <br /><br />And everything that was left out of the book. The ballon night chase, the marking of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more. <br /><br />And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /><br />I could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. Don't see this movie but read the book. It's a classic of Bradbury.,negative;Movie
"This film is so old I never realized how young looking Ray Milland looked in 1936, I remember him playing in a great film, ""Lost Weekend"". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very rich banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy. They hire a man to pose as a very rich Count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin, (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then Penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice I have every heard, the entire police department and convicts started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film. This is Deanna Durbin's first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.,positive";Movie
I had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on DVD at Christmas. Having reserved a special slot for it last night, I sat down to watch it with my daughter (aged 17 and a Film Studies student), with chocolates of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austin.<br /><br />After just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk. The shaky camera shots and angles, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied. Despondent, we viewed on.<br /><br />Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked oddly and with no particular purpose, directly at the camera on several occasions, breaking our hard-won 'fantasy of the moment' and engaging us directly in an almost 'I'll find you' stalking fashion.<br /><br />Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did his best with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall, drenching him and his co-actor. They were nearly swept out to sea. Health and Safety would have had a field day! Poor Rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line. Presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re-shoot of this scene. Anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place.<br /><br />Other than Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave the only convincing performance as Lady Russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of Anthony Head's unconvincing portrayal of annoying Sir Walter Elliott.<br /><br />Towards the long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared to oddly grace Anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being. In contrast, Anne ran, hyper-ventilating, from pillar to post in search of the good Captain who, in the meantime, had managed to call upon almost the entirety of Bath we are told, in the course of only three or four minutes, without even having worked up a sweat.<br /><br />We experienced none of Anne's charms crossing the screen. Indeed, we were left wondering what charismatic Captain Wentworth had ever seen in plain, spineless, opinion-less Anne and why someone, anyone, did not tell mean, winging Sir Walter to just shut the heck up.<br /><br />The crucial kiss, normally our favourite girlie moment, was painfully drawn out. As they moved in closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met. Eww! <br /><br />The most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been.<br /><br />What a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story, filmed in some of England's finest scenery.<br /><br />Sorry Jane.,negative;Movie
If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie!! <br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to see this movie!!,positive;Movie
"A rather silly little film you just may love.<br /><br />Although rather corny and cliché at times, it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun. Five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest - just for the sheer joy ""knowing yours is the best team.""<br /><br />Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughton's first film role after his Dr. Pepper ""Be a Pepper"" commercials and before his major 1981 hit ""American Werewolf in London"". Also features Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman-esquire roll a year before he became known for it. And last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox gets his first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside of that, no names, but all funny characters.<br /><br />Doubt it has ever made it to DVD, but there are still probably some VHS copies floating around and you might even catch on a late, late show sometime. If you do, is worth your watch. You may hate it, but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love.,positive";Movie
This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.,positive;Movie
I never fell asleep during a movie. Never. This movie did the impossible.<br /><br />While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts, this movie was a lesson in over abundance. As in, the movie was 30 minutes too long. It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work, but instead, all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement. The acting was absolutely terrible, bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad-lib something called a script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they coaxed to be boring and dull? Either therory wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />What was even worse was the rather unscary make-up involved with the creatures from the other side. Either way, they all stunk. Don't watch this film. That's all I can say (unless you're an insomniac).,negative;Movie
"What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before, was strictly for IAN McSHANE.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. He's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film.... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong, solid performances. These people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them ""mailed"" their appearances in. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.<br /><br />I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL's performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie.<br /><br />The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life, not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. Anybody who expected a clear-cut, by-the-numbers, connect the dots ""conclusion"" or ""answer"" at the end of the movie... CLEARLY wasn't watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the ""meaning of life"" is! The idea is that after seeing the film, you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did.<br /><br />No car chases... No explosions... No bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull, huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved.<br /><br />****** WARNING...****** If you're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous ""question"" as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly...<br /><br />YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.,positive";Movie
"Originally harped as a sequel to ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word ""massacre"" in your film's title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called ""Cheerleader Massacre??"" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good. It tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be, but even that fails. The ending ends up being a ridiculous mess. Folks, if you run across this film, walk away and go find the original ""Slumber Party Massacre."" 2 out of 10.,negative";Movie
A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.<br /><br />The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a sequel. <br /><br />4/10,negative;Movie
Days of Heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films I have ever seen. In no way, shape, or form would I recommend it to anyone...unless you're trying to put your kids to sleep or, God forbid, give someone an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters. Why? Days of Heaven's plot is simple, but extremely vague. Long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. The only things working are your eyes, and unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of Linda, the little girl in the story, who talks like a man. I am now dumber for seeing this movie. Don't let it happen to you.,negative;Movie
"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their ""Silly Symphonies"" series, ""The Skeleton Dance"". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's ""Laugh-O-Gram"" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color.<br /><br />1937's ""Skeleton Frolics"" is essentially, a remake of the 1929 classic ""The Skeleton Dance"", the movie that borough him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is set on an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that's about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a happy tune. Now, it's not easy to be a musician made of just bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: it's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves.<br /><br />Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, ""Skeleton Frolics"" follows faithfully the pattern set by ""The Skeleton Dance"" years before, although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than ""The Skeleton Dance"", although sadly, this doesn't mean it's necessarily a better film. For starters, the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney, with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all.<br /><br />However, it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all, Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for ""The Skeleton Dance"". In other words, while DeNat's tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, it's easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk's flawless work of animation. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, ""Skeleton Frolics"" would be remembered as fondly as ""The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking, as it's still a fun film to watch.<br /><br />It's kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he did not lack the quality of those companies' films. It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disney's mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney. Despite its shortcomings, ""Skeleton Frolics"" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can't help but thinking of ""The Skeleton Dance"" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that Iwerk's skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us.<br /><br />8/10,positive";Movie
Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.,negative;Movie
You wear only the best Italian suits from Armani, hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements. Your automobile is the finest that German engineering has to offer, and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood. You're a member of the finest polo clubs, frequently dine at restaurants such as Spago, and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi-automatic .22 caliber gun. You snow ski in the Alps, go deep sea diving in the Caribbean, sky dive over the Andes, and all the while your hair is never, ever, out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the world's most renown spy, favorite son of the good Queen, bad boy of the British SS, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming, and is the movie industry's longest lasting icon, being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades. The latest man to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took over the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996, and made his 007 debut in Goldeneye.<br /><br />This is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. Its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is, and no review library would be complete without it.<br /><br />Let's face it -- most of the time movie-licensed games are flops. Although the two seem like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the Star Trek flops, are ammunition enough against this mix. And for the record I am not a fan of movie licensed games, especially if I've seen the movie. At least that's how I used to think. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than normal. While not a bad movie, Goldeneye the film didn't have that much appeal to it, and I don't rank it in the top ten amongst Bond movies. As a game, however, let's just say it's a completely different story.<br /><br />The game is a first-person shooter, and in order to be successful, you'll need at least as much brains as brawn. For those who have seen the movie, which I imagine is most of you reading this, the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation. A plot to control the world's most dangerous satellite, Goldeneye, has begun in the USSR, and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured. Your missions will be many, the danger extreme. You will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known. M will brief you as soon as you're ready. Good day, James.,positive;Movie
"This is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It should have managed a wider distribution as it's much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is an almost-Olympian, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of horndogging from his female students. He attempts, more or less, to fend them off, with varying results.<br /><br />The students characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class. Several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.,positive";Movie

"I watched Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - he's only in it for around 10 minutes and has one long scene, the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes are also delightful, thankfully, mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the bumbling banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is everyone's foil. He stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure. Also, his comedy partner, Mary Boland plays his wife, Flora. Joining in the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use up most of the picture. Gracie's funny, quite, but she can also get tiring. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat Gracie all the time. I don't remember laughing at him once (although he has one great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles tries desperately to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields to sell him a sweater; that bit is exclusively Fields', though). The situation is constantly funny: the Whinneys are going to drive to California, but to help them with expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.,positive";Movie
EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me somewhat of Warren William), heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour.<br /><br />Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast--everyone from Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith, Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and H.B. Warner. As an added bonus, there's Nat Pendleton as a dimwit detective--and furthermore, get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home. Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.<br /><br />On the plus side, the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled. It's all suddenly clear to detective Philo Vance--and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense.<br /><br />Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.,positive;Movie
This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. I'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. I didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. I don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that was good.,negative;Movie
Although I was hoping that I'd like it a little more, this was still certainly an impressive film. There were great performances by all the leads, and the story, while not what I'd call chilling, was still effective and it kept me interested. For me, the best part of this film was the look of the picture, for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well. I also thought that the low budget suited this movie, for I don't think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim. All things considered, it fell a little short of my expectations, but I'm still very glad that I finally sat down to watch this movie.,positive;Movie
"Imagine this: a high school. Except it's boarding school, and the kids don't have parents around. Oh, and it's in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the ""weird"" outcast. And there aren't any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.<br /><br />Here's the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a formerly all-boys school. Absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She's the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her likable.<br /><br />Are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to Zoey's perfection, we're bad people? In the show, nothing's her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they're portrayed as the bad guy(Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.<br /><br />Her loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, Michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and Logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.<br /><br />What ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. Wow, they have it hard! Any other problems? I'm too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what's the 101 for, anyway?) is Nick's attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. Except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn't like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on The Hills.<br /><br />But hey, at least the set's pretty.,negative";Movie
I had been amazed by director Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /><br />It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either. <br /><br />What you are left with is one implausible situation after another, a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography, cast and the tight music score, you're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. <br /><br />This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.,negative;Movie
"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one.

Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a flick I just had to see. It looked like a fun low-budget horror/action/western that I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I rented it anyway hoping for laughs. Only a few laughs were to be found. This was an extremely stupid movie. It begins with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film. He looks/acts like he could take on Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue sucks too. Anyway, he goes into a village, shoots some zombies. You could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes 3-5 minutes to reload or watch some zombies. At least the zombies look cool. So anyway, some people get shot, some zombies die, and in the end, everyone is dead except our main character, who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people.,negative;Movie

"Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems, nonetheless, to be regarded as a perfect ""catch"" by any woman that runs across him; could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the film?

It has the production values of a TV-movie (check out that head made of clay or something, near the end), and the ending cheats in a way that I can't reveal, in case anyone wants to see the movie (highly unlikely).

"I was drawn to ""Friends"" by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous Elton John whom I had see in a club in nearby Houston. I had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make. Recently I was brought back to the movie by a song that Heart did called ""Seasons"", then I found the Elton John song ""Friends"" thinking it was the same song...it's been 35 years of so. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of ""Friends"" came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love. I have more recall of the way the movie hit me than I do of the actual details of the production, plot, etc. so forgive me for a rather poor review. I remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary-eyed at the end as I was. I'm both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now. So many movies which seemed so important to me back then (i.e. ""The Graduate"" ""Easy Rider"") now just seem silly and I don't want this to fall into the same category. But, I will find it and if it turns out silly, then at least I'll be able to turn my wife onto a great...no..outstanding soundtrack. When we met, we went through this with ""Last Tango in Paris"". The youngsters I work with (I'm 56) respect my opinions but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little ""aged"" now. I just can't figure out if the the aging process is the movies... or me. ""Friends"" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It will bring back a lot of special feelings I'm sure. By all means, rent or buy a copy... Indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today.,positive";Movie
"During the Clete Roberts preface, I was beginning to think this was an Ed Wood production, however, what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff. The story of crime and corruption in a Southern town is told using a cast culled from Hollywood's Poverty Row, and this makes the movie all the more realistic. There are no punches pulled here, and at times the film is reminiscent of ""The Well""(1951). The Black and White texture gives a newsreel-like quality.

(I shall say no more about that, for fear of inserting a spoiler!) It is one of those 'quiet' movies as opposed to guns blasting, explosions raging, car chases, etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish, but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans, whilst also inserting sadness into the story, along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so-called 'horror' movies.<br /><br />There is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film, where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her Christmas tree for company and looks so 'innocent', but, what she becomes!!

"Empire of Passion starts out deceptively - that is, if you're immediately expecting it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two and a dutiful, hard-working wife to rickshaw driver Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's at home with the baby, the feisty and aimless young man Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some goodies for Seki... and a little extra. They're soon sleeping together, but after he does something to her (let's just say a ""shave""), he knows that he'll find out, and immediately proposes that they kill Gisaburo. They drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well. Naturally, this will come back to haunt them - but that it's literally, at least to them (at first super-terrified Seki and then only later on skeptical Toyoji), changes gears into the 'Kaidan', a Japanese ghost story.<br /><br />This is a film where the horror comes not simply out of ""oh, ghost, ah"", but out of the total dread that builds for the characters. In a way there's the mechanics of a film-noir at work throughout, if only loosely translated by way of a 19th century Japanese village as opposed to an American city or small town (i.e. the snooping cop, the ""evidence"" found possibly by another, word getting around, suspicions aroused, etc). It's compelling because Seiko actually was against the plan from the start, manipulated by the lustful but ill-prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to Gisaburo's re-appearances are staggering to her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: Gisaburo's ghost, pale-blue face and mostly silent, chilling stare, motions for Seiko to get on the rickshaw. She does, reluctantly, and he pushes her around on a road she doesn't know, in the wee hours before dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric.<br /><br />While it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end, there's so much here that director Oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work. After hitting it huge in the international cinema world with In the Realm of the Senses (which, ironically, got banned in his own country), he made something that, he claimed, was even *more* daring that 'Senses'. Maybe he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also starring Tatsuya Fuji, a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range), but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread. You can believe in ghosts in this story, but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would-be lovebirds will go. The snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries: the fate of their very souls is at stake.<br /><br />And Oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp (sadly, it wouldn't surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and crafts shot after gorgeous shot, with repetition working its way into the mis-en-scene (i.e. the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that road, the camera at a dutch angle, the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue) as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after I finish typing this (i.e. Toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion, or how Seiko's nude body is revealed after she becomes blind). It's daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit- not to be confused with the spiritual, though there may be something with that as well- about life and death's connections to one another, inextricably. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.,positive";Movie
I am not a big music video fan. I think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song.. Any song. In other words , creative thinking goes out the window. Likewise, Personal feelings aside about MJ, toss aside. This was the best music video of alltime. Simply wonderful. It was a movie. Yes folks it was. Brilliant! You had awesome acting, awesome choreography, and awesome singing. This was spectacular. Simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man , but was he a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing adding to the song and video. MJ was MJ , enough said about that. This song was to video , what Jaguars are for cars. Top of the line, PERFECTO. What was even better about this was ,that we got the real MJ without the thousand facelifts. Though ironically enough, there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. Folks go to Youtube. Take 14 mins. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is.,positive;Movie
"Oh, my goodness. I would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than Domestic Disturbance this soon, but here it is. Armed with rotten plot, terrible editing, stilted acting, and headache-inducing 'style' (sorry, I have no other words for it), Sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re-evaluate an entire genre; that is, this film is so bad that even the thrillers I condemned as complete failures now seem a little better.<br /><br />Now, not only Sanctimony is a terrible film in itself, it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it. Right from the main titles -- nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from Se7en -- I was under the impression that something didn't smell quite right. As soon as the movie started with a series of corny, wanna-be hip quick-cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors, I knew where that smell was coming from.<br /><br />It turns out that two policemen, or rather policeman Jim Renart (Michael Paré) and policewoman Dorothy Smith (Jennifer Rubin), are investigating on a murder spree in Vancouver. A serial killer, known as ""Monkey Killer"" (what a menacing, chilling nickname, uh?) for his working methods, has killed quite a lot of people. You see, this nut apparently works following the proverb ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" and cuts eyes, ears, and tongues out of his victims. So far, six eyes, six ears, and three tongues. In very ingenious fashion, Renart and Smith figure out that the Monkey Killer is probably going to kill other three people... well, because he probably wants to complete the number 666. So suddenly the film focuses on Tom Gerrick (Casper Van Dien), a young, successful, good-looking businessman, with a dreadful temper. And that's where the rip-off of American Psycho kicks in.<br /><br />So we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath, none of which is interesting in the least, until they finally meet. Along the way to that, a disco where Renart barely misses Gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory: Renart goes in the back of the disco club, because... well, just because the script tells us it's a suspect place; then, with one single punch in the stomach, Renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path, and the guard is never heard of again? Does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic?<br /><br />Anyway, after another murder, Gerrick turns in as a witness, but Smith and especially Renart immediately suspect he might be the killer. In typical Basic Instinct fashion, Smith gets some dates with the young businessman, under the assumption that she might discover his true identity.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending but it is, quite simply, an embarrassment; there are contradictions, some plot holes, issues that never get resolved, and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder, supposed to be shocking and sad, comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that I frankly can't imagine how anyone could not laugh at it.<br /><br />At 87 minutes, Sanctimony is really pushing it. You never care about one single character, because they are all so flat (not to mention boring) that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them. You are never pulled into the story, because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place. The acting ranges from average (Van Dien) to downright atrocious (Rubin, and most of the supporting cast); the music is abysmal generic techno, and the photography is one of the worst I have ever seen. Of course, like every fiasco of the genre, we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity.<br /><br />3/10,negative";Movie
The Man With a Golden Arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction. The other two were Monkey On My Back and A Hatful of Rain. But I think of the three this one is the best.<br /><br />Maybe if Otto Preminger had shot the thing in the real Chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet. Who knows, maybe Preminger couldn't get enough money to pay for the location. It's the only flaw I find in the film.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss Robert Strauss when the game was raided. He took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer. But a whole lot of people are conspiring against him.<br /><br />First Bob Strauss who wants him back dealing, especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town. He uses a few underhanded methods to get Sinatra's services back. Secondly Darren McGavin is the local dope dealer who wants Sinatra good and hooked as a customer again. And finally Eleanor Parker his clinging wife who's working a con game to beat all, just to keep him around.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra got a nomination for Best Actor for this film, but lost to Ernest Borgnine in Marty. Sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn't won for From Here to Eternity in the Supporting Actor category a few years back and that Marty was such an acclaimed film in that year. His scenes going through withdrawal locked up in Kim Novak's apartment will leave you shaken.<br /><br />Eleanor Parker does not get enough credit for her role. She's really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants Sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost. If she had not been nominated that same year for Interrupted Melody, she might have been nominated for this. 1955 marked the high point of her career. <br /><br />Darren McGavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler. His performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl.<br /><br />Elmer Bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak Chicago neighborhood the characters live in. Not a place you'd want to bring up your family.,positive;Movie
This film was basically set up for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.<br /><br />I maintain the only way for these two books -Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned- to work in a live action form would be through a mini-series. First off the the Vampire Lestat alone takes place from the 1700's to the 1980's and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat sets up the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed.<br /><br />Lestat was not cruel and vicious to all, he was not wanting to go along with Akasha's plans, Marius did not make Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or make her, Lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light, Marius was not after David nor the other way around, every character was completely represented wrong, BASICALLY same names different story.<br /><br />If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels, fine. But don't piggie back into the theaters off the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love.<br /><br />If you haven't read the books you won't understand the film really, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a huge fan I had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it. Catch 22, must see it, will hate it.,negative;Movie
"Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a ""worst case scenario"" of playing ""strong"" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don't waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...<br /><br />I give this 2/10 it really was awful, if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it, its all the good things this movie isn't.,negative";Movie

What a frustrating movie. A small Southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces, as anyone who has read anything by Carson McCullers already knows. This does none of that. Instead, the writers settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a made-for-TV movie, and was directed with no particular distinction, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting.<br /><br />The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this--well, there's no other word for it--drivel. A tragic waste of talent, in particular that of the great Stockard Channing.,negative;Movie
"This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s, Jack Pearl (radio's ""Baron Munchausen"") as well as Jimmy Durante. However, 7-1/2 decades later, it's being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.<br /><br />As for the Stooges, this is a film from there very early days--before MGM had any idea what to do with the team. At this point, they were known as ""Ted Healy and his Stooges"" as Healy was the front man. Fortunately for the Stooges, they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man (read up on him--you'll see what I mean) and the rest is history. Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others). In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And, oddly, in this film they didn't act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle. When they are rescued and brought home, all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show--punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there. As for Pearl, I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films, as he has the personality of a slug (but slightly less welcome). As for Durante, I never knew what the public saw in him--as least as far as his films are concerned--he was loud and...loud! He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton's career to make this film. Together, Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor(?) and Vaudeville-style routines that tend to fall rather flat.<br /><br />In this film, the Stooges they didn't yet have the right chemistry. Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd. What they did in the film was pretty good, but because all the segments were short, they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines. Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this, though die-hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life-long goal of seeing everything Stooge--even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films (oh, and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly).<br /><br />Overall, the film is rather dull and disappointing. However, there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess. At about the 13 minute mark, you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing. Look carefully, as this is Walter Brennan in a role you'd certainly never expect! Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the ""Clean as a Whistle"" song starting at about 22 minutes into the film. This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so-called ""Pre-Code"" scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 (when the Production Code was strengthened). Despite the word ""Clean"" in the title, it's a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh--enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything! It's quite shocking when seen today, though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s. Finally, at the 63 minute mark, see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades. See the film, you'll see that I mean!,negative";Movie
"When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking into her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than ""natural causes"". The closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.<br /><br />If you're into sleazy, Satanic-themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can't save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total bore. Other than the one scene I've already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy. The acting is spotty at best. Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot really doesn't matter. Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. I'm only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, Black Candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can do.,negative";Movie
"One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a ""cold case""-style thriller. It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills.<br /><br />Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. This attitude is very old-style and provincial. It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem.,positive";Movie
I've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it takes to get into music school), Britney Bashing, etc, etc. so let's focus on the movie and the message.<br /><br />I have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult male.... 2 out of 10.<br /><br />I like pop/rock music, i'm 45. I know of Britney Spears but never realised she actually sang Stronger until i read the credits and these reviews. I didn't recognise her poster on the wall so I was not worried about any 'self promotion'.<br /><br />I watch movies to be entertained. i don't care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and does it entertain me.<br /><br />I watched this movie for the message. The world's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest. The movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids. I found the Texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable. Great message though...should be more of them.<br /><br />This movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get Hannibal.,positive;Movie
I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema, made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies. It is filled with Super-surfer Greg Noll's home movies, and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50-year passion. Nevertheless, it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory. It is filled with artistic talent, and athletic talent, however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic. Surfers are not astronauts nor test-pilots. Nor are they surgeons(perhaps) or Ph.d's(again, perhaps). It believes in the quest of the surfer. It believes in the beauty of human goofiness. It believes in the great gift of peace, which comes from the cessation of war. Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before. It celebrates the down-time of a country which fought a cold war-instead of a hot-war - with the Russian socialists. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It is dangerous, but only slightly historical. I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique. He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received. This movie has no military heroes. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers conquer has a beer-stand and and a surfboard shop. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate. It is the joy of exhalation.,positive;Movie
I had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode. It was dumbed down to such an extent, I doubt if I learned a single thing. The graphics were rudimentary.

Although the plot of this film is a bit far-fetched, it is worth seeing just for the performances of Michaels Caine and Gambon. The latter delivers a truly wonderful Dublin accent.

"This movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. It should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an ""African"" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond ""fro""? It's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.,negative";Movie
"When I was a younger(oh about 2)I watched Barney for the first time, and liked it. BUT, back then I didn't exactly have a brain, either. And now I look back and see what a horrible show ""Barney"" really is: First of all, EVERYTHING on that show is creepy. Barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about ""imagination....""(*shudders*) B.J.(I know what your thinking about his name.)Is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be ""supposudly"" cool.

Baby Bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of a character EVER. She is a green triceratops(it's a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. Her remarks of ""hee-hee-hee"" and Barney's praises cries of 'super-deeee-doooper"", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the Seventh graders learn about shapes and manners.<br /><br />And that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible.,negative";Movie
Steve McQueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there. He certainly was a charismatic fellow, one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew. But even McQueen can't save this turkey of a film, shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in St. Louis.<br /><br />McQueen's a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang. There's more than a broad hint that there's a gay relationship going on between young Steve and David Clarke. He's not liked at all by the other heist members, mainly because of his lack of criminal resume. <br /><br />Steve also has a girl friend in Molly McCarthy and she suspects something afoot, especially when he starts hanging around with Crahan Denton and James Dukas as well as Clarke, all pretty rough characters. That would certainly get my suspicions aroused.<br /><br />The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim did mostly documentaries and Stix didn't do much of anything. One of those two jokers decided Steve's performance was best served by doing a bad Marlon Brando imitation. <br /><br />This film may go down as the worst ever done by Steve McQueen. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would have if they saw this.<br /><br />Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey.,negative;Movie
"This is a bad film, as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr. Huston should have been proud of making. However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of ""Pre-Code"" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!! <br /><br />The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want him back, as she realizes he's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).<br /><br />Surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to. It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it--tacking it on to still another film. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women's prison (though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there). What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate. And, as a result of all this violence, Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer.<br /><br />But then, out of the blue, another type of film emerges and the women's prison reform business goes by the wayside. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but he desperately wants her. Now throughout the film, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl--even though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less tricked into it). But now, single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man. He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only, but she never thinks to investigate if this is true, and with his assurance, off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business! BUT, while she's pregnant with his love child, he's indicted for being a crooked judge. He assures her he's innocent, but he's convicted and it sure sounds like he's a scoundrel--using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune. Then, in the final moments of the film, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released. The film then ends.<br /><br />So, we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like. I gathered that she should be a strong-minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! This really undoes all the positives about Dunne's character and it's really hard to imagine anyone liking the film. A strong women's rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak-minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect! With a decent re-write, this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film, but it couldn't make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull Pre-Code film.,negative";Movie
I caught this movie on the Sci-Fi channel recently. It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go. Two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff. Definitely worth checking out.,positive;Movie
"(Very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) <br /><br />IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go...was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles, but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D, not much more then that.<br /><br />The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled ""Pick of Destiny."" Again, the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times it felt a bit long; it's only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine, except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss, they miss bad. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.<br /><br />I will say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing; The D's humor simply couldn't work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But unless you're a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. ""Pick"" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? I don't think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just be sure it's your style.,positive";Movie
I shall begin with a disclaimer: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching. The movie relies on the audience's knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements. And it does so very subtly. Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise it'll be that much better.<br /><br />With that in mind, this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed. The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game, on steroids. Yeah. The attention to detail in each scene, especially in the heavy action oriented ones, is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe.<br /><br />I believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again, for those who are familiar with the FF7 story and background, the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation).<br /><br />Once again, I myself having only played through FF7 once, thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from Square Enix. And that is the feel in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoyed the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this film will blow you out of the water. If you're in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as FF7 on Playstation or PC, doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film. Characters move with fluidity. Each scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot, I urge you to reexamine the animation. Facial reactions, subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery.<br /><br />Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has ushered in a new era for CG animations, allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves.<br /><br />Thanks Square Enix. The wait was well worth it.,positive;Movie
"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. Everything about it--acting, directing, script, cinematography--is dreadful. The alien (a human in sparkly suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes the scriptwriter meant ""galaxy"" but didn't bother to get a dictionary to check his terms. A better title for the film would be ""It Came From the Planet of Plot Contrivances."" The plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent. The humans are all given magical MacGuffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot. Any thought to the passage of time is ignored. Now it's a couple days after meeting the alien, then BAM! all of a sudden there's only a couple hours left until zero hour. Do yourself a favor and miss this movie. You will make yourself stupider for having watched it. The ending is particularly silly, and should have been accompanied by someone going ""Ta-Da!!!!"" as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt. I think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you'll get cancer watching it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without crapping yourself (""enemies of freedom""--honestly) laughing, you're retarded.,negative";Movie
"If you really really REALLY enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with a voice-over narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working out of a bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination. Throughout the movie the two scientists (and a girl they rescued from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye, and horrid acting), but to no avail. I guess they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly.<br /><br />The title of the movie ""Phase IV"" is something of a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but ""Phase I"" starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach ""Phase IV"" until the end credits roll. Apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed Phases 1 - 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report: ""Hang in there buddy! Only 1 more phase until final credits!"" As a MST3K episode, this one wasn't very good for two reasons: 1) This one is from the Season 0 on KTMA when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad not even J&TB can lighten it up. There are one or two Gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 Gamera movies.<br /><br />The movie does have a trick/surprise ending, but I was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me.,negative";Movie
"Joseph Brady and Clarence Doolittle are two sailors, who have a four-day shore leave in Hollywood.Joe knows everything about girls and can't wait to see Lola, while Clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls.They then run into a little boy, Donald Martin, who has ran away in order to join the navy.They take him home and meet his beautiful aunt Susan, who wants to be a singer.Clarence wants Susie to be his girl, but his shyness gets in the way.But he doesn't feel shy with a waitress, who comes from Brooklyn, like he does.Soon Joe notices he's in love with Susie.The boys are in a fix when they lie to Susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don't even know.As they are in a fix with their feelings.George Sidney's Anchors Aweigh (1945) is a great musical comedy.Gene Kelly is top-notch, once again, in his singing and dancing routines.Frank Sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from Brooklyn.Shy isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Frank Sinatra, but he plays his part well.Kathryn Grayson is fantastic as Susan Abbott.We sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88.The 9-year old Dean Stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor.Jose Iturbi does great job performing himself.It's magic what he does with the piano.Edgar Kennedy plays Chief of police station.Sara Berner is the voice of Jerry Mouse.There's a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers.Just look at Kelly and Sinatra performing ""We Hate to Leave"".It's so energetic.""If You Knew Susie (Like I Know Susie)"" is quite funny.It's a nice moment when Frank sings Brahms' Lullaby to little Dean Stockwell.It's lovely to listen to Grayson singing the tango ""Jealousy"" .The most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world, and there Gene sings and dances with Jerry Mouse.Also Tom Cat is seen there as the butler.They originally asked Mickey Mouse but he refused.The movie was nominated for five Oscars but Georgie Stoll got one for Original Music Score.Anchors Aweigh is some high class entertainment.,positive";Movie
From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class, and I recognised the leading actress, so I tried it, despite the rating by the critics. Basically cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie 'The Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e.g. non-relating hairs. The plan doesn't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. Adequate!,negative;Movie
"Things to Come is an early Sci-Fi film that shows an imagined world, or ""Everytown"" through 100 years. You can break it up into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film spans from 1940 to 2036 and is mainly about how this ruler or the ""Boss"" wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again, after Everytown was bombed and war broke out.<br /><br />This film only has about 3 faults: it's audio is muddy and video had some quirks, the characters aren't deep at all, and the overall plot isn't altogether solid. The plot is lacking something that I can't put my finger on... it just seems a little ""fluffy."" But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.,positive";Movie
"Weak,stale, tired, cliched; wants to be Basic Instinct, but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives, new insights. Insipid, trite, grotesque, and without the possibly-redeeming value of brevity; oh, wait...it was only 90 minutes long...it must have just *seemed* a lot longer! I'd rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again. I'm expressing an opinion here: I guess this means I didn't like it.,negative";Movie
One word can describe this movie and that is weird. I recorded this movie one day because it was a Japanese animation and it was old so I thought it would be interesting. Well it was, the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge. On the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not. Very strange, if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out.,positive;Movie
While i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem. I don't know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right.<br /><br />The story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is Deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on.<br /><br />I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was sorely lacking in special features. Oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring. But all in all a excellent movie.,positive;Movie
this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film.....,negative;Movie

"This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in.<br /><br />As far as the actual film goes, it could have used a better edit, it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also, thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. She's not a ""10"" like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite.<br /><br />If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you, the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones.<br /><br />Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!!,positive";Movie
"A fey story of a Martian attempt to colonize Earth. (Things must be pretty bad back on Mars.) Two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported UFO crash. Whatever landed is buried under the ice at Tracy's Pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner.<br /><br />The diner has had no customers since eleven o'clock that morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus, although he didn't notice who they were. The problem is that there are now SEVEN people waiting for the journey to be resumed. One of them is an alien, but which one? All of them are suspect. There's the crazy old man (Jack Elam), of course, who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit. There's a blustering businessman who must get to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Execrable performance by the husband, Ron Kipling.) Except for the couples, nobody has noticed anyone else. And even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride to newly minted husband: ""I could have sworn you had a mole on your chin."" The story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way -- the phone rings for no reason, the lights go on and off, the juke box turns itself on -- and none of it is to be taken seriously.<br /><br />It's a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle. There is no discernible ""depth"" to it. It's not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens. It's not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses.<br /><br />I always enjoy it when it's on. It's especially interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman, knowing that in 1954 he was the Roman Senator who masterminded the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM's version of Shakespeare's play. And here he is -- with three arms.<br /><br />Oops.,positive";Movie
"It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter.,negative";Movie
Relentless like one of those loud action movies. The entire cast seems to be on speed. I didn't quite get the director's intentions if any. I wonder if she's ever seen a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is one hell of a mess and I loved Abba. The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to enjoy it so it probably it's just me.,negative;Movie
"This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space.

"In an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.<br /><br />Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).<br /><br />Timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?<br /><br />A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen.<br /><br />Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub, and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse, but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsRay, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and Moss because she is so bloody yummy!<br /><br />This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.,positive";Movie
"An extremely down-to-earth, well made and acted ""Rodeo"" Western. No gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60's and 70's West. But hats off particularly to Slim Pickens for giving what I think was his signature performance, especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life. His role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ""ups and downs"" of the hard-nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style. He and Mr. Coburn teamed up extremely well as partners, not only on the circuit itself, but also in the real world outside the corral. Also, check out Anne Archer as Coburn's Native American love interest in the latter part of the movie. Must have been one of her first roles. <br /><br />Not as flashy, perhaps, as ""Junior Bonner"", but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal. Thanks to the Encore Western Channel for showing this true grit of an under-rated movie from time to time.,positive";Movie
Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.,positive;Movie
"""American Nightmare"" is officially tied, in my opinion, with ""It's Pat!"" for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Seven friends (oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of ""Friends"") gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It's hosted by a guy with a beard. That's the most exciting aspect of his show.<br /><br />Chandler, Monica, Joey, and... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening...<br /><br />Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. These fears include such stunners as ""voodoo"" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.<br /><br />No. Really.<br /><br />This movie was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse's killing spree lacks motivation, there's nothing to make the viewer ""jump,"" the ending blows, and--again--voodoo?<br /><br />If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent ""American Nightmare"" with them.<br /><br />If you care for your loved ones--even a little bit--go to your local Blockbuster, rent all of the copies of ""American Nightmare"" and hide them in your freezer.,negative";Movie
"First off, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9th grade class, and it was great. We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial. The movie was so disappointing to me. The movie cuts out some characters, and misses a lot of the main points of the book. It skips around a lot, and doesn't explain anything in detail. If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing in this movie to me, was the ending. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of ""melting"" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.,negative";Movie
This movie was extremely boring. I only laughed a few times. I decided to rent it when I noticed William Shatner's name on the cover. It's all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates. When wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he befriends several pimps. When mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil' Pimp must lay down for his homies.<br /><br />The animation isn't very good in this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It doesn't suck, it's just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn't think any of it was funny.,negative;Movie
"I was disgusted by this movie. No it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows one piece of art work that she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial.<br /><br />I don't know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia (aka had sex with) while she states over and over again ""It's true"".<br /><br />I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about. Don't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work.<br /><br />Don't see the movie, but find out the true story of Artemisia.,negative";Movie
"Such a joyous world has been created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; we're immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film, but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer  when it's in the right hands that is  A Bug's Life is a warm reminder. We walk out of the film with an equally-warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high-calibre film productions.<br /><br />It is only Pixar's second animated feature. The sub-group of Disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995, with their landmark movie Toy Story. It was a movie which defied convention, re-invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now, they return with their sophomore effort which, to be honest, draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film.<br /><br />After all, it's a film about ants. Well, all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film, as humans are the focal point in dramas, romances and so on. How can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie, let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film? Surely they jest. However, we forget that in Toy Story, a bunch of toy-box items were able to become the grandest, most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted. The guys at Pixar manage to pull off the same feat, and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you'll probably ever encounter.<br /><br />Not only are they all entirely amiable and likable  there isn't an unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are riveting characters  but they're colourful, they're eclectic, and they're idiosyncratic. And the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term, only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto A Bug's Life from the beginning. We shall start with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. Out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one considered the 'black sheep' of the clan, as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season's harvest with his antics.<br /><br />The problem arises in the fact that the ants' harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants; when they show up to Ant Island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone, they go insane, for lack of a better term. Hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack's hands; however, it's a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil. The cogs and clockwork in Flik's mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame, and he offers to leave Ant Island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony's rescue and fight off Hopper and the grasshoppers.<br /><br />If you think about it, A Bug's Life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line's of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, in which a village of hapless but good-hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies  one lone village-dweller goes in search for help in the big city, finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil. In A Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of a down-and-out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-room brawl.<br /><br />Much amusement comes out of these scenes, and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs. Among them are an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), a side-splitting obese German caterpillar by the name of Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatale ladybug who's in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It's exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on-screen, as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on-screen, as is the entire movie collectively.<br /><br />As I've said, much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another, which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines, wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the film isn't restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be, although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film  the clichéd kid-friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we'd like. However, it's easy to ignore this fault, and it's incredulously easy to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Although A Bug's Life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor, this is still a superb movie, and the start of something promising here. Pixar have proved that they're not just a one-hit wonder, but instead a much-gifted and talented group of film artists in Hollywood. They raise the bar endlessly, and when someone always manages to top their standards, it's only always by themselves. What more is there to say about A Bug's Life other than: see it; it's not quite the best which we've seen from the folks at Emeryville, California, but this beats out the lot of its year  and I'll be damned if this isn't the best animated feature of 1998.<br /><br />8.5/10,positive";Movie
What an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel. I do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original. This version is no different. I felt that the Ralph Fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of Juliette brioche as Kathy has got to be the worst casting decision EVER...anyway back to this version. It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style. It succeeds in both but high art it is nit. Throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe...The direction was average and the editing abysmal. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma does a great turn as Hindley and is in fact one of Britains wasted talents. The part of Heath was played with great charm and belief and I think that the casting is the strongest point of this project. Although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. Its clear that he was a director for hire and didn't instill the project with the passion that it deserved.,negative;Movie
My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger. It's about Andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But of course, Nicole isn't that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i'm guessing. She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10,positive;Movie
It is surprising that a production like this gets made these days, especially for television. Considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes, not to mention lesbianism, this has been given superb treatment and direction.<br /><br />The sets and costumes are flawless, the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable. There is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes. The protagonist is really a tragic figure, but not devoid of happiness. Also, this production avoids the mistake most films/shows make when dealing with homosexuality/lesbianism. The characters are very human. It seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on TV and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay. Not so with this. In Tipping the Velvet, the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means!<br /><br />The BBC have made some wonderful productions in the past, and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts.,positive;Movie
I just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. Someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the Federation just leave the damn Medusans be? There's one part I do like, when Kolos is speaking through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even at its lamest, I'll always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under $3.,negative;Movie
This is one of my all time favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone. On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones on par with it are movies such as The Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home.<br /><br />I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls. She really sucks you into her life. I also certainly can't fault any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't make me blush tooooo hard! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colourful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also hilarious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it.<br /><br />Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're funny, they're refreshing and they make you feel good! ^_~,positive;Movie
"I know that you've already entered this in film festivals (or at least I think you have, I may just be making that up) but I think this should get ""best animated short film"" in every one. Bravo. I can't wait for the full film. I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Okay, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text... Though I still mean it. And here comes yet another -SHOE!- and I cannot stop here yet. This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic ""Jason Steele Marathon."" I do have a lot of those.<br /><br />-R,positive";Movie
"This is probably the first entry in the ""Lance O'Leary/Nurse Keat"" detective series; in subsequent O'Leary films, he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee.<br /><br />A group of relatives (all played by well-known character actors) gathers in an old house (on a rainy nite, of course!) to speak to a wealthy relative, who goes into a coma.<br /><br />While they wait for him to recover, all sorts of mysterious goings-on happen, including a couple of murders.<br /><br />A creepy film; worth seeing!,negative";Movie
This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. It was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. Why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? It's quite effective.<br /><br />Fire and Ice, in it's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it's esthetic quality. I for sure did not mind! Bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he has to apoligize since it's pretty much animation for adults. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it.<br /><br />This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly Bakshi's finest. For those who like animations with lushious women: try Space Adventure Cobra as well.<br /><br />I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.,positive;Movie
My ratings: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Character Attachment - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10<br /><br />This show sucks very much officially. For me, CSI Miami is the best, CSI NY 2nd and CSI 100th. I don't know, in the other CSIs you get into the episode you're watching. But in this one, you just can't get into the episode, no matter how much you try, so in my opinion, this show is not worth watching. I know people have different opinions, and I respect that, but for me, this CSI ain't good enough. So if you like suspense, real acting/performance, good plot, direction, character development/attachment and you an overall good show, I suggest you to watch CSI Miami.,negative;Movie
"I am not a Faulkner fan (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); however, I think this is an excellent movie. On par with the quality of the movie ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"". If you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. It's well worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently played the movie as a part of the Race on Film series. I wish they'd play it more often. Very moving.<br /><br />On a side note, the folks from Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the 1940's. The Courthouse, City Hall, etc.: They're all on screen. I never knew the movie was filmed there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in the front of City Hall, I began to get suspicious. Look closely at the pennants on Chick's wall: You'll see two for Ole Miss !,positive";Movie
Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films. The film delivers the spell-casting special effects that one can expect, but fails painfully on all other fronts. The actors all play extremely silly caricatures. You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny. The plot is predictable, and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow. Towards the end, the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films, including shabby larger-than-life special effects and a (well, yet another) ghost with a Godzilla head. Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting camp.<br /><br />It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula. They won't be able to do it again: the cash cow is now dead as a dodo.,negative;Movie
"I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton, and sure it's his company. But ""you're fired"" or ""you're hired"", for how many seasons now? After watching the show I wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I'd love to hear just one person get up and say ""Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo"". I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.,negative";Movie
"If I had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />The last French movie I saw was ""Romance"" and it too was pretty dismal, but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- it'll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.)<br /><br />,negative";Movie
"The story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies. Ri'Chard is great. He really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. This is a little too""real"" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but I don't want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.,negative";Movie
"First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. <br /><br />I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the ""plot twist"" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of Superman. When the crying super-child throws a piano at Lex's henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. It's been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. <br /><br />My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. I don't know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. <br /><br />My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a God-like Jor-el sent to Earth to be a savior. Jor-el wasn't all-wise, he was just a scientist. And he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I'll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ's primary weakness. Furthermore, the ""crucifixion"" scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite ""spear"" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie ""Superman Returns: the Passion of the Christ.""<br /><br />And speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint has to do with Singer's depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns, as well as all the previous Superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous Superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singer's next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!<br /><br />To summarize, I don't know what I hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already. Don't see it, don't buy it when it comes out on DVD, don't rent it...basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact, I think that for every person that sees this movie, Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you're a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.,negative";Movie
This is one of the best TV productions of a musical ever. I have heard the Merman cast album, the Angela Lansbury album, I have seen Tyne Daly live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is if not the best, then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful. The three strippers, led by the always-dependable Christine Ebersole are hard to top. There was supposed to be a TV production of Mame a few years back, with Cher, but I think Bette would be the best bet (pun intended) for Auntie Mame.,positive;Movie
I am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference: no porn.<br /><br />The story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul. Maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable. At the very least, the pacing should have been picked up.<br /><br />While I accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had, he should have spent more time on the story or better yet, get someone else to write it. Many of the action scenes were just pointless.<br /><br />It was a complete waste of my time.,negative;Movie
Is it a perfect movie? No. It is a weird adaptation from a sci-fi book and it features vampires from space, naked beauties and the British army efficiency.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie I was rather young and all I can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and Mathilda May. Actually, if it weren't for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie, I probably wouldn't have rated it so high, but given her sheer magnificence, I am now actually considering voting it up!<br /><br />Lucky for me I got reminded of the movie and watched it again now. Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci-fi story, but with completely over the top performances. I still enjoyed the movie tremendously (as well as Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia, comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a sci-fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie. Oh, and did I mention Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?,positive;Movie
Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of The O.C but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that I very rarely see television tackle.<br /><br />BSG dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films/television shows, which deal with the subjects I referenced, I think you will find at least something here.<br /><br />In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way, I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon's belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.<br /><br />The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays 'Lacy Rand'. While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something I think needs work. I also found Magda Apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. This again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident.<br /><br />Based on the pilot I greatly look forward to seeing where 'Caprica' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that BSG once did.,positive;Movie
I'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season, from the b grade to the Hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn't to good, compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz (quite good) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both Ice-T and the other dude, this kills the Jamaican, however Ice-T is unharmed, very similar to Ice's other movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) were Snoops character is supernatural, however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird, Benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word wide-was a good part of the film, even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was OK tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films, however if u don't love em like i do Don't WATCH IT. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars, and my love of the genre.<br /><br />Nathaniel Purez,negative;Movie
"I am a huge fan of the Farcry Game, HUGE fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 games list of all time! The story line was new, fresh... A truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on... or so i thought...<br /><br />Farcry the Movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise (see Doom: The Movie, and many more...).<br /><br />The Video Game begins as the player (Jack Carver) awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an RPG from an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him across islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES, to find his (lady friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the wile battling mutated super soldiers, and genetically enhanced animals.<br /><br />The Movie plays out very, very differently: 1: There's a needless 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) of ""backstory"" before we even get to the 'boat blowing up' scene. 2: Jack then walks onto the beach, kills some goons, then drives off... Nothing like the game... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle on the other end... 4: The 'Modified Soldiers' look like albinos with singlets on... And there was no mutated 'monkey-like' creatures jumping out of the bushes. A part of the Farcry game i enjoyed allot... 5: There is no sun filled beach scenes, no aircraft carrier, no communications stations on huge cliffs, LITTLE reference to any in-game contents (characters/items/vehicles), in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all. 6: The climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building. 7: There's an Ending scene... where everyone (except Krieger) live happily ever after... WHAT THE!<br /><br />I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a Gamer, you will HATE this movie will all your soul. It is a movie clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away... So if your a male, 12-29 years of age, have never played Farcry, and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books/games to the cinema... then this is for you...,negative";Movie
"one of the best ensemble acted films I've ever seen. There isn't much to the plot, but the acting- incredible.

"I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /><br />When asked about my favorite films, this is the one that I seem to always mention first. There are certain films (works of art like this film, ""Dark City"", and ""Breaking the Waves"") that seem to touch a place within you, a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive, that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer, not unlike a life-changing event, such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend...

"Today, I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood.<br /><br />Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911 changed everything. It changed our perception of security. It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity. Most importantly and devastatingly , it changed our world.<br /><br />However, I can't not stress how utterly repulsed, disillusioned, and angry I am at the careless, blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction. This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word-of-mouth among moviegoers and critics alike; most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press. Hollywood has sunk to a new low. Even lower than the low-down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty. Behind it all is Uwe Boll. I am very angry at this movie. How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost? How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post-911 world?!?!?! How...dare...they? <br /><br />To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty, I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength: Remember. Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person. Think back to that day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day. Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones. Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes. Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you have a soul.<br /><br />Think. Remember. Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all.,negative";Movie
You cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed. That's why movies like Fast and the Furious, Dhoom, Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences, especially local ones. We live on a tiny island, and I cannot fathom why, for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system, most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100% tax when they reach our shores, and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one. Not only that, the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear, lest they reach the sea.<br /><br />And these movies are relatively easy to make. Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic. For once, those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long, can't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these. Of course there are amongst us (ahem) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects (otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models, and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame), however, they don't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen, even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park. The guy sitting beside me, I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s) appear, and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.<br /><br />So there we have it, the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie. With the Fast and the Furious franchise, the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage, as does the GT. Here, the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool-worthy facade modification, that even I'm impressed, alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos, Porshe Carerra GTs, Koenigsegg CCXs, and every car out there that has wings for doors. But seriously, my heart goes out to the cars each time they're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment. I mean, this are perfectly fine, high performance models that are at the apex of motoring, but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow, they do so because they can,<br /><br />There's no story in Redline, just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties (the cars that is) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible, and with the usual shots of pedals (always the accelerator, mind you, tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy, and earn you no respect), steering wheels, gear shifts (always shifting up and not down), all these while having the actors make pretend that they're the baddest asses with an engine, snarling and giving each other dirty looks. Not a very tall order for an actor, and that's why we get the most woeful performances ever, with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.<br /><br />The heroine (yes, it made a statement that girls can drive) Natasha (a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who don't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil, who has racing pedigree within her, and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable (every line had to do with cars, and when singing about love, just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts, lubricants and going for rides). Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous (Eddie Griffin), she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran, and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle. Everything else, well like I said, just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.<br /><br />And it's almost always the same, as there's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars, especially when you know the race is rigged (for narrative reasons) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line. While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors, and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker, Sun Kang, and of course, the star it created - Vin Diesel, Redline had none, just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately. It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go, with a very insipid opening sequence where it's one man, one car, and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.<br /><br />If not for the cars, then this movie seriously is a piece of junk, with bad acting, bad lines and bad action. Strictly for the car fans, or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines.,negative;Movie
Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish! i think i could of done better myself. i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul.,negative;Movie
"Seven Ups has been compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but does not come anywhere near matching Bullitt. Bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, gets into his Mustang, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now torn down) and notices the Charger sitting nearbye, you know you are about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed. Adding to it is a terrific Lalo Schriffin If I remember correctly sound track. This goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing. That shot of McQueen's Mustang suddenly appearing in Bill Hickman's rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect. Then of course, San Francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends. Also, Bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still ""Hot"" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels then two boring, smog device laden Pontiacs in the 1970s Seven Ups. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies. I saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I was doing movie reviews for a paper. They gave it a good try in Seven Ups though with the chase scene. Seven ups had a few ""jumps"" over little hills, (Yawn) but of course they were not San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups chase, where they are actually going fast, is longer than the go fast sequence in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.,positive";Movie
"Have you ever heard the saying that people ""telegraph their intentions?"" Well in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque ""Southern"" accents employed by British actors.,negative";Movie
"""Night of the Living Homeless"" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of Season 11. Obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably Dawn of the Dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.<br /><br />Kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. More homeless people begin to infiltrate South Park, until the town is completely overrun with them. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming ""I don't have any change!!"" Unfortunately, the refugees end up losing Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. Then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.<br /><br />The boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They find out that the nearby city of Evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to Evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. This scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in ""Fantastic Easter Special"" two weeks ago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. Randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. When the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, Randy pulls the trigger.<br /><br />In Evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to South Park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. The boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of South Park and takes them all the way to Santa Monica, California.<br /><br />The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10,positive";Movie
"<br /><br />I'm not sure who decides what category a movie fits into, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As for the story, it was fairly interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed with the ending though.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />Tell me why on Earth does she run over to her uncle's(?) home without at least calling the detective or the police first? She knows exactly what's going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. Instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying ""I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect proof, did you?!"" Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her. Well DUH! Of course he's going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything. What a dumb ending.,negative";Movie
I gave this a 1. There are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for. Total mayhem. Everyone gets killed or nearly so. I am tired of cross hairs and changing views.

Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sage's touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline. This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you've seen something special.(7/10),positive;Movie
I read the book before seeing the movie, and the film is one of the best adaptations out there. Very true and faithful to the book. Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing. Robbins is a talented filmaker and I wish he would add more to his repetoire. He made the film very haunting and intentionally slow-paced to add depth. An especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end.,positive;Movie
DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a brutal story about a brutal man. A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet, he preys on the weakest amidst the populace. The imagery and cinematography are superb, and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and murderous. A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, for his chilling portrayal.,positive;Movie
"I just got this video used and I was watching it last night. The acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. The tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the CGI effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like Twister. The scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. The story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old ""disaster formulas"" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.<br /><br />While this movie had a very weird mix of FX and acting quality, this merits an A in my book.,positive";Movie
This film is really vile. It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context. I'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't/aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol. And of course he knows how to play the system. Does that sound familiar. Yes. This turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. It's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this.,negative;Movie
What a horrible, horrible film. The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!,negative;Movie
"Motocrossed was fun, but it wasn't that great. I guess I just didn't understand a lot of the Motocross racing ""lingo"" (and there was A LOT of that in the film)! The plot wasn't what I expected from the Disney Channel previews, so that could account for some of my disappointment.,negative";Movie
"Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood; now he wants to broaden his horizons and (**SPOILER**) needs a family member in order to do it.<br /><br />A failure as a horror movie because it simply ain't scary at all. Works better as a dark, macabre black comedy, to tell you the truth. Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer. (Too many wisecracks, that's for sure.) The actors aren't interesting (save Robert Englund, as always, and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto) and there are simply far too many visual effects. The finale is OK but doesn't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope.<br /><br />In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer's story, it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non-makeup scenes than ever before.<br /><br />There are cameos worth noting: a joint cameo by then-couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value, an appropriate appearance by veteran shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.<br /><br />Film debut of Breckin Meyer, who plays Spencer.<br /><br />One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits.<br /><br />4/10,negative";Movie
OK, I'm Italian but there aren't so many Italian film like this. I think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. But it's the only little mistake. The Consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. I'd like very much the lighting work on it. The best thing on it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. But it's only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it's too slow, it's so boring, so many silences, but i think that this components its fantastic, its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl, the grand-daughter of the Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian films.,positive;Movie
"If you only see one Ernest movie in your life, make it this one! This is by far the best in the series, with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages. The other ""Ernest"" flicks were good too, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not ME, however.).<br /><br />In this movie, Ernest P. Whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case. The murderer, Nash, just happens to look EXACTLY like our bumbling hero Ernest.

"The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was, on the non-literal level, a ""man vs. cruel nature"" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels.<br /><br />The second movie, Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still, for being fairly entertaining, I rated it a 5 out of 10.<br /><br />The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. There is no ""homage"" or ""tribute"" here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say).<br /><br />That we see something from ""behind the scenes"" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. And, in this movie, those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.<br /><br />The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.,negative";Movie
I have just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words - the creators planed to make comedy not drama. Howsoever, at the end I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was earnest about this movie. It's a pity because: the dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fishy tale! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance! What to say for Jason Statham - lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction... For this reasons I vote: 3/10,negative;Movie
I believe Shakespeare explained what I just read beautifully. Me thinks he (the lady) doth protest too much. The whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself! He sites profane literature (writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible) a number of times however I can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible. Anyone can skew data & prove anything they like but it doesn't make it true. Customs change, word definitions change over time (look at English & German where it is very obviously a common root) nothing stays the same, it's always growing and changing. The bible has many different translations but the King James version is the one I've found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research. In the King James version you will notice there are certain words written in italics. These words have been added by the translators and can be dropped & the mean of the entire verse changes. Writings from around the time of Christ were written without spaces, without punctuation, without paragraphs & without numeric verses. These writings look like one long word & the translators added all of the above. For example how would you read this: GODISNOWHERE do you read it as God is nowhere or do you read it as God is now here? Same string of letters two entirely different meanings. This is why many biblical researchers use a 'Lexicon' to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written. It's also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove God exists but you can not prove He doesn't exist! In the end I just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty. Talk about ego! Putting soapbox away, God Bless Maegi,negative;Movie

"This is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it, it has lot's of laughs, guns, action, crime,, good one liners, and a decent plot, with an over the top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comedic role as an Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too, Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the lead character ""Max"" a DEA agent Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow from Frazier on TV, plays the bad guy,, ""Livingston"". The plot centers around Max and Diane trying to capture Livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throw into the mix the Assassain Sutherland, who pretty much has all the good one liners, this is the perfect crime caper, there is the usual love story,, but played very differently than you would think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have the Russian mafia, Italian Mafia, and Chineese Mafia here thrown into the mix,, the film is shot in Boston,, where you have some great shots , and locals,, great photography and music in this film, this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy,, it has everything that one could ever want.

"Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War. This time we're told about the story of Carol (lovely played by débutant Clara Lago), a little girl which comes to live to a little Spanish village from New York. It is such an initiating trip, and soon she'll find about the injustices of the human race, their stupid fights and conflicts, their contradictions.<br /><br />Imanol Uribe makes his best film since ""Días Contados"" (1994) with such a sober pulse, a beautiful photography, and a nice script. He tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and let us decide (ok, the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in) and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta.<br /><br />A well cared production.<br /><br />My rate: 7/10,positive";Movie
"A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.<br /><br />It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film ""Rollercoaster"". This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to ""Death of Ocean View Park"".<br /><br />As to the film itself, the storyline of a ""supernatural"" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don't believe this film was intended to be another ""Citizen Kane""; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; ""let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!"".<br /><br />For the casual movie viewer, this would be a ""see once and forget about it"" film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a ""walk down memory lane"" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first ""Harborfest"", and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome.,negative";Movie
I was expecting a lot from Mr.Amitabh Bachan's role of SARKAR, but am disappointed. Being a Ram Gopal Verma's direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie. Sarkar is supposed to be a strong character, but the movie shows that Amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his. There is a movie in Tamil called Nayakan based on the theme of GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has played the lead. The movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of Kamala Hassan, not his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things. The movie fails to show the strong impact of God Father.,negative;Movie
"A trio of buddies, sergeants all in the British Army, carouse & brawl their way across Imperial India. Intensely loyal to each other, they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented, implacable guru. Now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment, the water carrier GUNGA DIN, to save scores of the Queen's soldiers from certain massacre.<br /><br />Based more on The Three Musketeers than Kipling's classic poem, this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in Hollywood's Golden Year of 1939. Filled with suspense & humor, while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum, it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the (sentimental) conclusion.<br /><br />It is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen & Douglas Fairbanks Jr., as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and, to all intents & purposes, indistinguishable. However, this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time.<br /><br />(It's interesting to note, parenthetically, that McLaglen boasted of a distinguished World War One military career; Fairbanks would have a sterling record in World War Two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict; while Grant reportedly worked undercover for British Intelligence, keeping an eye on Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.)<br /><br />The real acting laurels here should go to Sam Jaffe, heartbreaking in the title role. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem ring true. He is unforgettable.<br /><br />Montague Love is properly stalwart as the regimental major, whilst Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru. The rest of the cast, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, are effective but have little to do. Movie mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the tiny role of Miss Fontaine's father.<br /><br />The film picks its villains well. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the hideous, blood-soaked Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the bane of Indian life for 6 centuries, ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840 the British military, in cooperation with a number of princely states, succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion.

This movie pretty much sucked. I'm in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. If your in the Military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do. It was a pretty gory movie I'd have to say the least. There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. I'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military.

I had to force myself to sit through it. I didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.<br /><br />The magical realism was completely missing because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.<br /><br />There was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of The Elektra Complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.<br /><br />(originally written 5/28/2000),negative";Movie
"I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies. I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted. To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot, the most suspense, surprises, most emotional,(especially the ending) and definitely the most episodic movie. I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic. All the good guys can't stay alive in a realistic movie, you know. Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon. Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yoda's death.. Well, nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope. (Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy) Why was Obi Wan's death okay but Yoda's not... hmmmmmmmmmmmm.... Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible. That is utterly ridiculous!! I can not believe this one!! First off, the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there. If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage. (Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage) They had swinging vines, ropes, logs set up to trip those walkers, and other traps. The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest. The only thing they had was their blasters. To add, it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves, they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest. I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros, the band of rebels, as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain, that would have been a great upset. Lastly, if this scene was still unbelievable to you.. How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the Princess, being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view!! And not only that, the heroes , of course, always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters. The troopers must have VERY, VERY bad aim then! At least in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers. Don't believe me? Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Lando's base. Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at (somehow they missed)as Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Star.<br /><br />The last reason that I care to discuss (others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here.) is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed! Well, in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie. Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father, Annakin Skywalker. It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his father's face because it made it complete. By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet). The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about. In fact, that's is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Luke's father...Isn't that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet?<br /><br />On another note, I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse (even if it is better) that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves. I never go into a film with that deception in mind, I always try to go into a film with the attitude that ""Well, it might be better or worse that the original .. But I can not know for sure.. Let's see."" That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was.<br /><br />I am not sure who criticizes these movies but, I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me (except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite) that it is ROTJ. I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading.<br /><br />Bottom line, the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy. This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes. There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful, exciting, surprising, or all of the above. For example, the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any day!!!<br /><br />Finally, I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky, insignificant details (or see it as ""just another sequel"") to trash the movie such as ""This movie stinks because Luke is not in it!"" then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunately.<br /><br />,positive";Movie
"Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned Gentleman's Agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying ""It's because I'm Jewish, isn't it?"" It's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the Warners' DVD doesn't mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish, there's little doubt in Sam Levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay  not a mincing caricature, but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier. There's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.<br /><br />There's an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Maigret-like detective, Gloria Grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. A big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC, which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews. So much for crusading,positive";Movie
This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved. It's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the 'villains'. In this movie those 'villains' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against. At first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German's are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.<br /><br />The way this story is told isn't however the best. It's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.<br /><br />The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn't even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.<br /><br />The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I don't know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that they're being played by well cast actors. All of the actors aren't the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.<br /><br />All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.<br /><br />7/10,positive;Movie
"So I rented this from Netflix because somebody gave me Roger Ebert's book ""I hated, hated, hated this movie"" and he gave this one a rare zero-star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review ""Mad Dog Time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor"". So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert's review of Rob Reiner's ""North"" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this ""movie"" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits. But after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot. Then there are a whole bunch of jokes about Dreyfuss being mentally ill. Haha. Not funny. Then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying Frank Sinatra's ""My Way"" sang by Gabriel Byrne apparently to insult Dreyfuss. Of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader Dreyfuss shoots Byrne over five times and Byrne just will not die. Are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny? I can certainly tell you I did not care or find that funny. Not only am I disappointed in Dreyfuss (who I admire much as an actor) for producing and starring in this tripe but I am also extremely disappointed in Jeff Goldblum because this was released the same year that ""Independence Day"" was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history. Did Goldblum feel that ""Independence Day"" would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if ""Independence Day"" were a bomb? What did an Oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this? The opening sequence of ""Mad Dog Time"" says that the movie is set on another planet. I only wish now that I have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that I will never get back. Ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough I am afraid. Every copy of ""Mad Dog Time"" should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire. I have yet to top a worst movie I have ever seen because this one has won it's honor as the worst movie ever.,negative";Movie
"What a boring film! To sum it all up, its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. Can someone say BORING??? The concept wasn't too bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, overall the cinematography came up short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie was the song ""Ishq Kamina"", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.,negative";Movie
"{rant start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie ""Gwoemul"" (aka ""The Host"") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film ""Shiri/Swiri"", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end}<br /><br />The only ""reason"" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes. Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 ""Dragonheart"", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember ""Dungeons & Dragons"" in 2000? Hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use, but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem ""Arirang"" being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).,negative";Movie
As a native Chinese, I can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a 'better world'. I said 'better world' because it is a lie that Chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years! <br /><br />I guess most western audience may don't know Qin Shihuang(means the first emperor), the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia(Chinese word was spoken by the king, means 'the land and the people') spoken from his mouth is totally lie. From then on, one after another, all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said.<br /><br />Another fact is, Qin Shihuang's empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people.<br /><br />Well, I do like the beautiful scenes of this movie, but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.,negative;Movie
"This had a great cast with big-name stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939.<br /><br />Now the bad news.......regrettably, I can't say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light....and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the ""good guys"" is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. Well, that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad.<br /><br />Hey Hollywood: here's a news flash - The James boys were criminals! Really - look it up!,negative";Movie
I remember watching this series avidly, every Saturday evening. It was the highlight of the week. I loved everything about it, the location, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved the way they solved the problem of Michael Praed leaving by creating another Robin, this time the Earl of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in medieval times. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors, I'm sure Robin and his men would have young, after all people didn't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looked like Robin's granddad). The only sad thing was the ending, it's a shame they couldn't at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending.,positive;Movie
"I don't normally write reviews, but this ""film"" was special. I couldn't turn it off. I don't believe I've ever seen a worse movie, but there I sat, watching. It was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn away. Where do I start? The movie seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so utterly ridiculous, it can only be a comedy, but it's not funny, not even in a dumb/silly way. It's like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get-togethers. It's painful to watch, but at least it's only for a minute or two. Second String went on for over an hour. <br /><br />Whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again. The writing, directing, acting, and everything was just terrible. The problem is I can't describe how bad it was; you just had to see it. And I'm sure this will NEVER be shown again, so unless you saw it, you're out of luck. I mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other ""bad"" film I've seen over my lifetime. And for every film I see in the future that I can't stand, I will think to myself, well, at least it wasn't bad as the Second String.,negative";Movie
"Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.<br /><br />(No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter's ""amazing"" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)<br /><br />Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.<br /><br />That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the ""star power"" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew Aaron) who's review was ""of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!,"" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I'm betting the older charas too) and loving the ""cuteness"" of the child characters.<br /><br />And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, ""Ponyo"" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names Soske (somewhat like ""The Little Mermaid""), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo's Mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.<br /><br />But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. <br /><br />Once human, she teams up with her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.<br /><br />In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will ""remember him fondly."" And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical ""bad guy."" Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a ""bad person."" All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br /><br />And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. <br /><br />In the end, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.,positive";Movie

I watched this movie on TV last night, hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease. I was disappointed, and I think the movie was garbage. It did not seem real to me. Some of the acting was awful, in particular that of the doctor. She was about the worst I've seen. The whole thing played like a CNN 'worst case scenario'. Even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn't seem sincere.

"THE GREAT CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most ""movergoers"" were stay-at-homes watching their new 7"" Motorola televisions. Almost all recent box office figures are false --- because they fail to adjust inflation. Obviously today's $10 movies will dominate. In 1951 it cost 90c to $1.60 at Radio City; 44c to 75c first run at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs. What counts is the number of people responding to the picture, not unadjusted box office ""media spin."" The genius of THE GREAT CARUSO was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of Enrico Caruso (really not a great story anyway) and threw it in the trash. Instead, 90% of the movie's focus was on the music. Thus MGM gave us the best living opera singer MARIO LANZA doing the music of the best-ever historic opera singer ENRICO CARUSO. The result was a wonderful movie. Too bad LANZA would throw his life and career away on overeating. Too fat to play THE STUDENT PRINCE, Edmund Purdom took his place --- with Lanza's voice dubbed in, and with the formerly handsome and not-fat Lanza pictured in the advertising. If you want to see THE GREAT CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $2.00 or less. Don't be put off by the low price, as it reflects only the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.,positive";Movie
"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. The ""specific"" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and ""wowing""...I haven't seen such angry seas since ""The Perfect Storm"". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. The film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.,positive";Movie
"1) I am not weapon expert, but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffles in WWI and WWII. In movie we can see privates, armed with ""M1 Garand"" (invented in year 1932!), not authentic ""1903 Springfield"" (aka ""Silent Death""), who privates use until WWII. Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi - automatic, Springfield requires reloading after every shot. Little difference?! 2) German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too. Especially - helmets. German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top, we cannot see even one in movie.

"The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend. Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better. For example, there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother's film, DUCK SOUP, yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp. At times, Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho, but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny! In fact, he just seemed to prattle pointlessly. His only funny quality was that he looked goofy--surely not enough reason to put him on film. Additionally, Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese--a piece of cheese that sang very poorly! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as ""who's on first"" which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing. In fact, soon after they started their spiel, they just ended the routine--so prematurely that you are left frustrated. I knew that ""who's on first"" had been around for many years and used by many teams, but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />Once again, I have found yet another sub-par film by this duo. While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly (such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS--which I actually gave 6's to on IMDb), this one was a major endurance test to complete--something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey. Where was all the humor?!,negative";Movie
I was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the show's creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. All of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All of the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm being nice). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />If you're Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that. It's only a problem when it isn't funny - as in this show.<br /><br />Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis. So how come the producers of this show couldn't find any?,negative;Movie
"First of all ""Mexican werewolf in Texas"" is not a werewolf movie. This title is bullcrap. The story is actually about a Chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of Furlough in Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something. And I guess it actually works because that's the reason why I bought this piece of crap, it sounded so stupid. Anyway the movie isn't any good. Actually it's bloody awful. But I didn't expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog, actors and some gore then you should check into this movie. But I must warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad.<br /><br />This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous. They almost never say a line in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say. It's so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody. It's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it. The worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo. She's the worst of them all. I have never seen an actor as bad as her (And I've seen Pteradactyl). Even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it. I hate her.<br /><br />Some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good. The ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project. But most of the movie is shot in the night when the Chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark. The gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are pretty hilarious really, but that's the way I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messed up, and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit.<br /><br />Overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death. I recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer.,negative";Movie
"This movie is so God-awful that it was literally a chore to watch. I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room, but kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right. ""You lose, we win, yay!"" This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks. And if you're even considering renting this turd (or worse yet, have!) I have one thing to ask of you: didn't you even look at the cover? I mean, with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is! ""Oy vey!"" This movie sucked.,negative";Movie
"The symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene... these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had. The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger... while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards, in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet the lover buys, and the love triangle at the heart of the story.,positive";Movie
I found this movie to be very good in all areas. The acting was brilliant from all characters, especially Ms.Stone and Morissey. Tramell's Character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute. The plot is interesting even though, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. The setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious,thriller like masterpiece. Go see this film now , it deserves better than what it got from the audience ,which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie(Before it even started).....You won't regret it,if you go see it...,positive;Movie
"Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a ""jollies"" project for Robert Redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br /><br />The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team-mates. Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another.<br /><br />Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br /><br />In truth though, there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters. One of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it.,negative";Movie
"I would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing, fun-filled, thought-provoking movie. The absence of sex, vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening. I especially enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but that's probably because I live a short distance from there. Even so, this film could have been produced in any city; it's the theme that's so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven dropped down on us. Try it...you'll like it!,positive";Movie
"This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.<br /><br />The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and ""with it"" to be understood by us mortals.,negative";Movie
I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The movie is diamond among coals during this era. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw. This film should have made them stars. Shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film. It could have easily been a franchise. Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film. Look for it in your TV guide and if you see it listed, no matter how late, watch it. You won't be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It'll blow you away. Times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we like to think they have.,positive;Movie
"A drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small Wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. Cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town. Hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as ""Lyle from Dallas,"" the real hit man. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. The script by brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and John's direction creates a terrific ""neo noir"" atmosphere. Witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up.,positive";Movie
I really liked this movie. I have seen several Gene Kelly flicks and this is one of his best. I would actually put it above his more famous American in Paris.

"Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice-cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity.<br /><br />The plot opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice-cream salesman in a Western Anatolia town, in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice-cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. But this is what he says; we actually don't see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real ""sahlep"" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business, they always quarrel, and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy.<br /><br />In a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for the theft, but, of course, nobody takes him seriously. Annoyed by the nagging of his wife, Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk. One of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist of the town, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and with no real connection, jumps to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing. When he returns home, suddenly we see that his wife understood his value, treating him like a hero and praising his manhood. Meanwhile, the thief boys got sick eating too much ice-cream. They confess to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end.<br /><br />Although the plot may look promising in a way, it's the story-telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy. First, the director doesn't show much of an effort to tell the story visually; everything is based on dialogs. And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's troubles are not convincing because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big ice-cream companies, but there is nothing in the film about big companies. We don't see their pressure enough. The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft. And when his motorbike is found, it solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. Not a real criticism of globalism.<br /><br />Second, the film is cheesy because of the crude humor. Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life, but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and ""clever"" but they are not clever jokes at all, they are just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars, or to have a political message! If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) or an old villager woman saying ""f**k you,"" then you may find this film funny.,negative";Movie
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital, and with nothing else to do, Stan decides to visit him, and take him some boiled eggs and nuts, instead of candy. Chaos begins with Stan curiously pulling Ollie's leg cast string, and manages to push The Doctor (Billy Gilbert) out the window, clinging on to it, getting Ollie strung up to the ceiling. When the situation calms down, Stan gets Ollie's clothes, as the Doctor wants them both to leave, and he also manages to sit on a syringe, accidentally left by the nurse, filled with a sleeping drug, which comes into effect while he is driving (which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen. Filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad (although repetitive and a little predictable) classic comedy, it isn't great, but it's a black and white film worth looking at. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Okay!,negative;Movie
"OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well documented failings. This however was the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD the effects are vastly superior. However the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the ""characters"" consistently verge on the moronic. I feel like trying out Uwe Boll's latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. OK there it is. I have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is House of the dead 2.,negative";Movie
I was -Unlike most of the reviewers- not born in the 80's. I was born on may 14th 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the style of the 80's. When other kids had playstations, I was playing Zelda on my NES etc. Now, this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review. I, because of my 80's style early Childhood, watched many TV shows and saw Many movies that other kids didn't see, and this movie was one of those, and one of the greatest too.<br /><br />It starts off in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. David, the Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. While they are talking, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave and to see the world (Even though, technically Dave is only going to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualify as ''The World''). David is leaving the Chipmunks in the care of Miss Miller, much to the displeasure of the boys. Soon Dave is off to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at home with Miss Miller. Later, at a local Café the Chipmunks are playing a game of ''Around the World in 30 days'' against the Chipettes(Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Brittany after having his Hot air Balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile, Alvin get's in an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien overhear their argument and, needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world, decide to fool the children into delivering them for them. They set up a race around the world, where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness (Secretely filled with diamonds) at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's likeness (secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds) to ''varify that they were there''. The winning team would then receive a 100.000 dollar reward. They do this because they believe that Jamal (An Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now) would never suspect them because they are just kids (However, this seems to be redundant, because on their travels, the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect that neither would Klaus or Claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally.) And so begins a great adventure. This film is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not like it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my french :P). My favorite song is without a shred of doubt ''The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll'' An amazing rock song that cannot be topped. It's also my favorite moment in the film. Other notable songs include ''Getting Lucky''(Kind of Suggestive for a kid's film eh?) and ''My Mother'' as well as ''Wooly Bully'' and ''Off to see the world'' Not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with ''My mother'' still brings a tear to my eye. In relation to the song ''Getting Lucky'' I first didn't think anything of it, but when I grew older and learned about life, it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive. That song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially apparent in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arabian Prince's men, when Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely. While this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film, it's one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4-feet tall Chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high-pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child. Anyway, A bit after that scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the Chipmunks and get home. The Direction of Janice Karman perfects this movie as she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr. know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross doing the voices for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice doing the voices for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes an appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arabian Prince, a very small, but important role. The ending is of course, a happy one. The Crooks have been caught, the loose ends tied and The film ends when the Children, Dave and Miss Miller are driving into the sunset, Alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100.000 dollar reward for winning the race, which annoys Dave until he finally yells ''ALVIN!'' and the screen fades to black<br /><br />Classic ending, by the way. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this flick, give it a watch, It's worth the money. This Nostalgic classic from the 80's gets a solid 10 out of 10. <br /><br />''Headin' for the top, Don't you know! we never stop believing now'',positive;Movie
"Just when I thought I would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a ""Bomb"" rating, a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night. I feared the worst knowing its reputation, and it was as God-awful as I'd anticipated. This is a Mexican-made mess, dubbed into English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It's got terrible sets and effects, and features a rather frightening Santa who doesn't operate at the North Pole, but instead from a cloud in outer space, and who doesn't have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is. The opening sequence, where St. Nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages, seems to go on forever, and with no story. Obviously, THIS Santa Claus doesn't observe the child labor laws!<br /><br />Eventually we get some nasty and slinky red-suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to Earth, just to make little kids naughty and turn Santa's Christmas Eve rounds into a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it's bound to frighten little children and turn them off Santa Claus and the holidays forever. Oddly, the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned often in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on. This easily makes my personal list of the ""Worst Movie I've Ever Seen"", but I'm sure that's nothing unique.,negative";Movie
As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost. Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off. What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.<br /><br />There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid. Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.<br /><br />Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal. Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia. In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.<br /><br />John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fiancé.<br /><br />I rated this film an 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing. The photography alone is worth the price of admission.,positive;Movie

I read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but I felt that it truly transported me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint. I watched this with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it. They had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film. It leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over. You feel for the characters and their plights. I highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghani culture. There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.,positive;Movie
Years ago, Sara, a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered, now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This film lulls the viewer, not into a sense of tension, mind you, but rather a sense of sleepiness. Deathly boring, I found it hard to sit through as I could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed 'mystery'. Is Sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, Who cares? And the answer to that, no one. No one at all.

"In short if you want to watch Burt Reynolds best films than this one must be included. If you don't like Burt you may still like this.

I have watched Love Jones over thirty times. It is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be African-Americans. The dialogue was realistically written, and delivered with honesty. It was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional African-Americans. This is virtually an untapped market. Love Jones was visually captivating as well. The chemistry between Lorenz Tate and Nia Long will bring memories of past and present love. The feeling of the film is jazz and blues, and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of Kahlua and Butterscotch. If you hadn't guessed, I loved it!,positive;Movie
"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10,negative";Movie
This is absolutely the best movie I have ever watched. At the age of 12 I was up late and ran across the movie. It was on the USA channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will never forget. At the time my friends and I were really struggling with different issues, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and weird age. It seems you are stuck in between being a little girl, and being a young lady. This movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me. I now have a daughter that is 12. Have been searching for a couple years for this movie. If it ever does come out on DVD I would be the first to buy. Would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age.,positive;Movie
Holes is an awesome movie. I love it a lot and it's one of my favorite films. It's one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isn't cheesy. Holes is generally a very cool motion picture. I wish Disney would make more pictures like it. Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool. Don't get the wrong idea, I don't mean to bad mouth Disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and THAT'S OKAY. Children deserve to have their entertainment too. But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail. But not with Holes. It's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny. Really, it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to.<br /><br />Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this.,positive;Movie
"I cannot hate on the show. When the old (and better) tech TV had to hit the bricks, the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in. ""Attack of the Show"" is the replacement for the Screen Savers, with 3 co-hosts in the beginning. They were Kevin Rose, Kevin Pereira and Sarah Lane. Brendan Moran came to be something of a co-host as well, but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show. Kevin Rose decided to leave the show, and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host, but that didn't pan out for some reason.<br /><br />Eventually (I just learned this from this very IMDb messageboard) Sarah Lane and Brendan Moran moved on because (hey, this is what I read) the two got married. That was a big secret to me! Now there is a new female co-host, the not-as-hot (my opinion) Olivia Munn. She's hiding something in those tops she wears, while Sarah Lane had a perfect body and she wasn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />AHEM! Sorry.<br /><br />""Attack of the Show"" deals with everything young people want to know about. It's music, movies, comic books, the internet and television. This is what's great about the show. If you don't want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching MTV, you can get all you want on AOTS. Some segments and bits they do are funny. They have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry, as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names.<br /><br />Even though the hosts aren't as geek as I'd like them to be, I still have found ""Attack of the Show"" to be entertaining, even with its latest lineup.,positive";Movie
Worst DCOM I have seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The acting and story was fine, but the effects SUCKED!<br /><br />They were so fake! The only good fight scene was between the brother and Shen. That was probably the only scene in which I was excited.<br /><br />Overall, I found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly. <br /><br />I will give it a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene.<br /><br />4/10,negative;Movie

"Some people may call ""Cooley High"" the same sort of thing as ""American Graffiti"", but I wouldn't. For starters, in ""AG"", everyone was white, whereas in ""CH"" they're all black. Moreover, this one has a Motown soundtrack. Specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.<br /><br />One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack. It is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on vinyl here at home). A classic in the real sense of the word.,positive";Movie
So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless. Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.,positive;Movie
This film is, quite simply, brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is completely convincing - so much so that when Donald Woods himself appeared on TV some years later, I recognised him from Kline's portrayal. Denzel Washington also turns in a masterful performance, as ever.<br /><br />I urge you to watch this. It is long, but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.,positive;Movie
"I have recently seen this production on DVD. It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered. At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then. (I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been. I am a bit of a ""Jane Eyre"" purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one. I have recently re-read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on. Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. <br /><br />All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way, some even leave out the ""Rivers"" family and their connection to Jane altogether. I also think this is the only production to include the ""Gypsy"" scene done correctly.<br /><br />The casting is perfect, Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book ""small plain and dark"" and I disagree that she looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester, portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time, like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted, his expression is fantastically frightening. But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another. A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable. Oh to be loved by a man like that! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however, like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things (I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).<br /><br />Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection!,positive";Movie
In a time of bad, if not plain awful, comedies, King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's a complete oxygen tank! It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times. Nothing has been this good since Married with Children. Kevin James and Jerry Stiller are comic geniuses! And believe me, it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius. These guys truly understand what is funny. I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldn't get half the laughs from seeing KOQ just once. Other funny people in this show are Carrie, Janet Heffernan, Spence and Doug Pruzan (Carrie's boss). I'm so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem. The show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers. Check it out if you haven't!!,positive;Movie
PREY <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion...<br /><br />Despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, Norman J. Warren's follow-up to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne's eye-catching cinematography), though Annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and 'left' under mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. There's an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to 'emasculate' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.<br /><br />In the early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially Annan's final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). Excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by Warren's unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings. Originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY.,negative;Movie
The tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of Scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick) a former paratrooper in the British Army, is the local dentist, he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. The islands serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp Inskip(Maurice Roëves) at the islands police station, Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP, Dr Goudry, for closer inspection. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin, Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.<br /><br />Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. With a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports of UFO's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.<br /><br />The Nightmare Man is based on the novel, Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire, it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blake's 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. The Nightmare Man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. The island setting is perhaps a genre cliché that has been used over and over, but its one that I enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to Camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. There is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point. If there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his/her/its POV for the killings, an acceptable cliché on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it's a fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. Imrie, never one i've taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production. The outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.,positive;Movie
"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review!<br /><br />While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character).<br /><br />Also, the tie-in with the photography/""You could be a model"" comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they made a Cruel Intentions 3.,negative";Movie
This movie is ridiculous. It's attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible. The whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it's a comedy. Truly is bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch it to realize there's a few jokes here and there going on but either way they're all inside jokes amongst themselves. This is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad. It really is a very pointless movie.Their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway. Unless you want to be bored out of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie.,negative;Movie
"In dramatising Wilde's novel, John Osborne has condensed events, eliminated a number of characters, and generally implied rather than shown Dorian's essential wickedness. If you want a more explicit rendering, see the 1945 film. Wilde and Robert Louis Stevenson lived in about the same time frame, but were certainly vastly different men and writers. This story really treats of a theme similar to Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", but note that Wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy, whereas RLS took the scientific route. Both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil, with evil winning in the end.<br /><br />The actors in this BBC movie, take a different route, too, from those in the 1945 film. John Gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as George Sanders, in his role really projecting Wilde himself, but with a subtle difference. You'll suspect that Sanders really believed what he was saying, but Gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes. Peter Firth, too, shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion, but then we don't get to see as many of his escapades as Hurd Hatfield had a chance to display.<br /><br />It's a very good production, with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel, if not all of its ramifications.,positive";Movie
It starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then just as quickly, it unravels into a direction-less mess. Who is the main character? Is this a serious film or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy film? Is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted? I have no clue. I found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end. I kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the have's have not's. I got it way back in the beginning. Kids and Bully was done in such a way that I actually felt like I was observing the realities of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and ever worse acting. Teenage Caveman, which Larry didn't write but did direct, was terrible. But at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was just plain bad.,negative;Movie
"This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its ""Sita"" character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta, not her direction. The characters, big and small, were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's ""An Unmarried Woman."" They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. <br /><br />Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however, compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mrinal Sen, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada, Malayalam, and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers.<br /><br />Ms Das, Ms Azmi, Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sen's ""Khandar"", Gautam Ghose's ""Paar"", Benegal's ""Ankur"") a brilliance notably absent in this film. Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. All in all, the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema. I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays.,positive";Movie
"All the way though i was thinking to myself ""Oh god why!"" At the very beginning i thought ""Right it might be average,"" but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious.<br /><br />Every part in it was so predictable, even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring, it was a half decent movie, but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves, Eg. The part were Geller falls off the building had me in stitches. My girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next, and more times than less i was right.<br /><br />Why does going into the house make her come after you, it doesn't make sense. It was a poor excuse for a lot of killings, and no really depth was seen at all.<br /><br />You can see everything coming, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh shes behind her ... didn't see that one coming *yawns*.<br /><br />Surely these people must have thought to... oh i don't know, carry a knife round or at least try and fight back, instead of being eaten but someone hair? At best during the movie i was very mildly scared (and i mean mildly), i was just crying out for the credits, as they rolled i exhaled a short ""Oh thank god."" If you haven't already, don't waste your' time and money on this; pointless, plot less, sorry excuse for a sequel!,negative";Movie
"At 2:37, a high school student commits suicide. Not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known, time skips back to the start of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.<br /><br />After losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director Murali K. Thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.<br /><br />With heavy and hard subject matter, Thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis's. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. It verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.<br /><br />2:37 has a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants film Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. Like Sant, Thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth, to show each characters interaction from different perspectives. A defining point to Elephant was its ethereal ambiance. With spare conversation, little development of characters, and the long tracking shots, Sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread. While there resides this dread in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level Sant couldn't reach. As time goes by, each characters fragility creeps out, dragging you along their emotional roller-coaster.<br /><br />The real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide, foretold at the very beginning. The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion. Though many films that have shown suicide, gloss over the act or romanticizes the act. Thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution. With unknowns in the leads and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers.<br /><br />Compelling and revetting, 2:37 is an absolutely unmissable film.,positive";Movie
"The quote above just about says it all for ""Slipstream"". I should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided I ought to be fair and give it a chance. I won't watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record.<br /><br />Some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character has hijacked Hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman.<br /><br />If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then I suppose you'll find something of interest here. But you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here, you're really stretching.<br /><br />Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming ""The End"" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. Yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the film was keeping them afloat.,negative";Movie
Director Edward Sedgwick, an old hand at visual comedy, successfully leads this Hal Roach road show which tenders a fast-moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting, employing a large number of Roach's reliable performers. Although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly, sunny Jack Haley stars as Joe Jenkins, a young Kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to Hollywood, where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves, star-struck Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick, who prefers using the entire M-G-M studio as his set, does so here as Cecilia, always ready for an audition, is treated by a would-be paramour, cinema star Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), to behind-the-scenes action of, naturally, a musical comedy, featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes, including their well-known skit involving a tiny harmonica, and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On balance, one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer, who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star, a role which he largely creates, and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeley's filmic spectacles.,positive;Movie

"These slasher pics are past their sell by date, but this one is good fun.<br /><br />The valentine cards themselves are witty, and well thought out.<br /><br />The film has one Peach of a line... ""He's no Angel...."" when he in fact IS Angel!!! Watching Buffy reruns will never be the same!<br /><br />The cast is a sizzling display of young talent, but the story does not give them enough real depth. Denise Richards on the DVD extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters. Sorry but NO!<br /><br />The direction is very good, managing to show very little actual gore, and relying on your imaginations implied threat. Much can be said also for the similar manner in which Miss Richards and Heigel do not remove their clothes...:-(<br /><br />Essentially, the main directorial plus, lies within the ""borrowing"" of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks. Psycho's shower scene is tributed, along with Halloween's ""masking"". <br /><br />Murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as I know!!!<br /><br />Light viewing, not very scary but a few good jump moments. If it was a choice between The Hole and this though, choose The Hole. Slasher movies have had their day, and this is just another slasher.

Like most, I thought 'another crocodile movie'. So far we've had Primeval and Rogue in the last 12 months, what can they do that's new? Where both those films were about action and violence, this one's about fear and tension.<br /><br />The performances aren't Oscar-worthy when there's nothing going on, but in times of distress or terror, these people suffer so much it's like torture. There are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don't really behave like this as others have pointed out, but the fear is so effective it's a stretch to say you'll enjoy this movie. It'll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as The Passion of the Christ.,positive;Movie
"There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick's abundance of clichés throughout -- and I agree completely, both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.<br /><br />I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly's awful performance in the equally-awful ""Showgirls,"" which I've never seen - and her performance here, while not awful, is barely up to the standards of Lifetime's worse fare. There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn't have been. If so, it would have placed the film completely out-of-balance, since there wasn't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character, performer, or portrayal.<br /><br />The principal's handling of Liz's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable. Her husband's initial reaction and advice were likewise (Forrest Gump, attacking Jenny's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic, intelligent action, and, hell, he was mentally-challenged).<br /><br />The smarmy, unctuous lawyer (excuse the redundancy) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance: he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time, no mean feat. Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd, also not unknown in the profession.<br /><br />Finally (and frankly, I rather enjoyed this part), the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs, that you'd rather depend upon Barney Fife, without Andy, to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community. I know that most real-like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness, intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the ""Law and Order"" series', and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on ""Lifetime.""<br /><br />Finally, I found a kind of ""story within a story"" fascination with Josh's concoction of his being the ""victim"" of his teacher. This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story. This was something of an achievement, like going from ""F"" to ""F-minus.""<br /><br />This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes, following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities, with husband involved. But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour's blank film in the camera. <br /><br />But the writer(s) here, proved with their ending, they could do even worse. When the situation was finally ""resolved"" and ""righted,"" this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds, with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any ""real world"" context for the perpetrator and his parents, or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.<br /><br />This one's a 2* presentation; the second ""*"" because it does have some mild ""fascination."",negative";Movie
"If you haven't seen this yet, you really should, on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It is amazingly realistic and believable. True, much of it is speculated, and I would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts (there aren't many of them), but it handles everything quite well with a ""Cruel Mother Nature"" theme. It will remind you of the nature programs that you've seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are Dinosaurs. They act natural; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. You will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others.<br /><br />For the most part, the effects are excellent. At times they will look a little too much like CGI's, but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. In some cases, you will actually be convinced that you've seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds. I was most disappointed with the T-Rex, however, which looked a little too computer generated at times.<br /><br />In any case, you should definitely see this production. It is educational, well made, and very entertaining. For what it is, its an A!,positive";Movie
"Why is it that Canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre, other then action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train wreck. I just could not change the channel, it's sheer stupidity sapped my willpower. Its pretty telling that the cast IMDb ""credits"" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again.<br /><br />Bad acting, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. It just goes on and on. The movie really has nothing to recommend it. If you're looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out, there are a tonne of other films that won't require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards.<br /><br />I hope this film didn't get money from the government for financing, otherwise I'm never paying taxes again.,negative";Movie
Ab Tak Chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in Mumbai, India. Sadhu Agashe is a hard working, hard-edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison. His loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers, Imtiaz, becomes frustrated by Sadhu's high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status. A new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and Imtiaz is angry when Sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case. Further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of Sadhu's tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics.<br /><br />I was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from India. The camera work is excellent, the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds. The acting, pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood, sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director, Shimit Amin, has taken liberties with factual accounts. Nevertheless, Ab Tak Chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film-making.,positive;Movie
Let's keep it simple: My two kids were glued to this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. <br /><br />And the Pepsi girl was excellent!<br /><br />And Kimberly Williams was pretty gosh-darned hot, although she's not in the film very much, so don't get too excited there.<br /><br />Not that's it's really a bad thing, but it is the kind of movie you watch just once. Don't buy the DVD.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for the dads.),positive;Movie
"It was 1 a.m. in the morning and I had nothing else to do. Don't judge me... please.<br /><br />We're back in time during the Spanish settlements. A group have made their way onto an island. It doesn't take too long before they encounter a large ""reptile"", which gobbles up their horse. Soon they're captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the ""reptile gods."" THE CG sucks; it reminds me of the CG of early console video games. The encounters were lame. The only positive thing I have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit. Otherwise it's just a middling effort.,negative";Movie
Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was superb. I felt as if i knew the characters. I could almost 'feel' them. They reminded me of people that I knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. Oh, the memories!! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. I have watched this movie so many times, that I can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. I can't even list my favorite part, because I have SO MANY favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and age...and that is Black people loving each other, looking out for each other, respecting each other, caring about each other, and doing all we can to help each other. Gotta go now. I have to go watch it again.,positive;Movie
"Saturday June 3, 6:30pm The Neptune<br /><br />Monday June 5, 4:30pm The Neptune<br /><br />Few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as Carlos Saura's brilliant interpretation of Isaac Albeniz' masterpiece Iberia Suite. At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve ""impressions"" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before Saura's camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.,positive";Movie
"As most people I am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that Hollywood makes. There seems to be no creativity in Hollywood. Companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in.<br /><br />This movie is a welcome change. It could be classified as romantic comedy for it's genre but don't let that turn you off this movie. This is a very original movie which is not like most things Hollywood produces.<br /><br />If you are reading this, you already know the basic plot so I will not bother going over that. The only movies that come to mind to compare this to are ""Interstate 60"" and ""Art of Travel"" which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the Hollywood garbage.<br /><br />This is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same.<br /><br />Dean,positive";Movie
Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow. Although the story-line was rather typical of Clara's later silents, I still find it somewhat heart-stirring and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy-go-lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves...never mind that this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie. Though definitely not a brilliant story-line (quite typical, actually), this movie is a nice showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.,positive;Movie
"As the number of Video Nasties I've yet to see dwindles, this little pile of garbage popped up on my ""to rent"" list when I saw it was available.<br /><br />The premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots. Some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip, though if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant cut. He's brought a helicopter and pilot with him and, wow, that pilot is one of the worst actors EVER! Granted, they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood. After stealing away into the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human King Kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour. Now, this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes and that's pretty much it. His growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack, and I found myself muting much of those scenes.<br /><br />Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? This is probably the main reason this film was banned, though there is one specific scene, about one second long, where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows lengthy close-ups of female genitals, and, sadly, male as well. So, if you want ""fair"" in terms of exploitation, you got it.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trash to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just atrociously padded trash that only a Video Nasty fan will probably view and even then, if you are making your way through the list, leave this for the very last. If you watch it first, you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.,negative";Movie
I rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case. Judge and Jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun, but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on. David Keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent. Judge and Jury was well plain dumb I gave it a 3 should have gave it a 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.,negative;Movie
"I found out about this film because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a funny British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this film. He failed thank God.<br /><br />The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin won't like her because she's ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits: ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit. Those two scenes made me cringe! Janeane's character is sickeningly arrogant (and guessing from her role as stand-up ""comedienne"" and arch-feminist is in real life too). She claims that the film is ""anti-feminist"" when in fact it's just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks over personality. It's interesting to note her hypocrisy too. She'd been a feminist and ""comedienne"" for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film. I mean come on! She acted in it for Heaven's sake! What this film was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle.<br /><br />There are other bad things about this film too like Ben Chaplin's character being the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx being the token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure. Is that the best the script writers could come up with? Blimey they've never done that before except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There's also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is. The other comments on here all say how Janeane Garofalo isn't ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm was I watching the same film as they were? She's certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one. Although having said that, I fail to see the appeal of Uma Thurman as well: she's lanky and gaunt looking.<br /><br />I guarantee three things about this film if you've never watched it:<br /><br />You will know what the ending will be;<br /><br />You will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and;<br /><br />You will be bored after ten minutes.<br /><br />Watch at your own peril.,negative";Movie

Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube, I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors, compared to the earlier black and white, are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short. It does get a little repetitious near the end. Still, Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony.,positive;Movie
"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander's better actors, many of who I have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine ""Under Siege"" meets ""The Love Boat"", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor, I recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.,negative";Movie
"Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - what a treat! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue. Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. ""Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life."" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. <br /><br />The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back due to family/partner pressure; one simply don't want to face the consequence; one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br /><br />The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It's not sensational or complex as another film ""Where the Truth Lies"" 2005. Credits due to Fellowes' writing and the nuanced performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. And following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /><br />You might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in ""Separate Lies,"" yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner (of filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs, especially: Bleu 1993.) This is a British film you just might not want to miss. <br /><br />Emily Watson (Anne, the wife): Breaking the Waves 1996 debut; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The Luzhin Defence 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /><br />Tom Wilkinson (James, the husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 opposite Laura Linney. <br /><br />Rupert Everett (Bill): He is simply delightful in ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" 1997 opposite Julia Roberts and marvelous in ""An Ideal Husband"" 1999 d: Oliver Parker, an Oscar Wilde play. Recently as Sherlock Holmes with Ian Hart as Dr. Watson, in PBS Mystery: Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stockings 2004 TV. <br /><br />Linda Bassett (Maggie): she was very effective as Ella Khan opposite Om Puri in ""East is East"" 1999.,positive";Movie
I am amazed with some of the reviews of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This film is awful. The plot is extremely lazy. It is not scary either. People out there who think that because it stars Sarah Michelle Geller it is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it. I was extremely disappointed with this film. It didn't scare me nor interest me either. Let's face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans. The films that are coming out of Hollywood, like this, are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer. They're just being churned out,negative;Movie
"Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but, being shy and somewhat of a recluse, she does all of her work from the confines of her condo. Just as she is about to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it. Angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela heads to Mexico but takes the disc with her. While she is sunning on the beach, a terrific looking gentleman named Jack (Jeremy Northam) makes overtures to her. She falls for them and the two end up on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it. Even after Angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the USA, Jack makes things difficult. He changes Angela's identity on every computer across the nation, making her lose her condo, her bank account, everything. Can Angela, a computer whiz, beat Jack at his own game? This very exciting movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation. The script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production, and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful. And, despite how it sounds, there is a great deal of exciting action as Angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy. If you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, this is a great choice. It delivers twists and turns with great frequency, making it possible for the viewer to ""net"" a very good evening of entertainment.,positive";Movie
I rented the DVD in a video store, as an alternative to reading the report. But it's pretty much just more terror-tainment.<br /><br />While the film may present some info from the report in the drama, you're taking the word of the producers - there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film. Not one.<br /><br />The acting, all around, is pretty bad - pretty much all of the stereotypes of 'hot shot' bitchy foul mouthed government agents, each thinking they know more than everyone else. There may be some truth to it, but it really has a bad Hollywood stereotype smell to it.<br /><br />IMDb's user community ratings & comments tend to be more right than wrong, and I have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever I can.<br /><br />I wish I had on this one.,negative;Movie
Look, this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies. But you must see this just to watch Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN' hot and a great little actress to boot! These types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a Coke and putting in this film. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree.. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. The movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard. But as soon as Lisa hits the screen, things really start hopping. The others are clearly not in her league. This is not the Exorcist but as I said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, this is the one to see!,positive;Movie
It wasn't until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producer/star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making . This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things , a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic . You know when you've been painting a wall until you're completely bored ? Well that's the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they're swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner <br /><br />The plot centres on Soloman the King of Israel having an affair with the Queen of Sheeba and his people not being happy about it . You can't really blame them since there's few things more beautiful in the world than those Israeli moteks , though the Israeli women here all seem to look like Cherie Blair ! Modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of Israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in European and American accents <br /><br />After much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed ( And no that's not praise ) we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered Israelis have to defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army who can't read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them . This is what I don't get - Even though their blinded by the sun the Egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the Israelis never ever realising they're charging towards a gaping ravine ! Isn't this somewhat illogical ? It's also something of a revealing error since the horses , chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures <br /><br />Anyway the film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory . But who needs Moshe Dayan , Arik Sharon or God when you've got an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall ?,negative;Movie
I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn't help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.<br /><br />I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias, I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br /><br />Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br /><br />Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br /><br />In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt. Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners. I did find his allusions to his last film interesting... Come for the humor, laugh and be merry.<br /><br />Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work watch it. If not watch something else...,positive;Movie
"I rented this film because of my interest in American history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons. This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion. It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo, Illinois. It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith. Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land. Despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.<br /><br />I found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. Polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised. The issue is not emphasized.<br /><br />I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.,positive";Movie
"1983's ""Frightmare"" is an odd little film. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre. It isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named ""Conrad Ratzoff."" At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he couldn't be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.<br /><br />It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an '80s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime, Mrs. Ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and ""reach"" Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life, it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we're in an '80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.<br /><br />I can't really recommend ""Frightmare"" to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s. ""Modern Horror"" fans will doubtlessly find ""Frightmare"" incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from ""Frightmare."" Fans of Jeffrey (""Re-Animator"") Combs may also want to check it out, as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.<br /><br />I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's ""Vault of Horror"" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma, which seems appropriate. If you're a Troma kind of person then ""Frightmare"" will be right up your alley.,negative";Movie
People watch movies for a variety of different reasons. This movie didn't have the big budget, there's no special effects, no car chases and there's no explosions. Actually reality doesn't have much of these either. At least not in my life. <br /><br />This is a very real movie about very real people, none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, since I'm neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain.<br /><br />So watch this movie for the characters. It is brim-full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk. <br /><br />Within the first three minutes Kiefer Sutherland enacts Detective Michael Hayden's life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie. Excellent acting, very believable. <br /><br />Henry Czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his 'Harvey' and Kiefer's 'Mickey' enhances the oppositeness of their characters.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady, 'Mrs Ramsay', I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends!!!<br /><br />There's a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them.,positive;Movie
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there, I actually thought quite the same as you do. But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do, I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them, but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it. So please, do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.,negative;Movie
"As usual, I am making a mad dash to see the movies I haven't watched yet in anticipation of the Oscars. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley. I can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has. There is no story!! A group of guys meander around Iraq. One day they are here diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Bagdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think is going to happen??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable! The camera is shaken around a lot to make it look ""artsy"". And for all of you who think this is such a great war picture, go rent ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""Deerhunter"" or ""Platoon"". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!,negative";Movie
"A group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's Jeep mysteriously won't start). One of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. When the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice Mr. Slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. He goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about ""Davy"", his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there. Of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same. This is a gem if you can find it; I had taped it off of cable when I was younger, and walking through a used video store I spotted a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it. Fans of Tanya Roberts won't be disappointed either. Best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup (and crackers!!)<br /><br />I gave it a 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain.,positive";Movie
"Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. ""Tommy Boy"" is a character right from ""SNL"" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.<br /><br />David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business.<br /><br />The plot, for starters, is really faulty. The whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be ""funny"" together.<br /><br />The movie's biggest ""influence"" is the 1987 comedy classic ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" That movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. It's basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But it's real, dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are far more real. ""Tommy Boy"" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. ""PTA"" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - ""Tommy Boy"" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.<br /><br />The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from ""PTA"" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie.<br /><br />Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - I've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. Spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie's most thankless character.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The ending is a joke, and not in a ""har-har funny"" way. More like a ""oh god are they serious?!"" way.<br /><br />Some people dig it, that's cool. But I just can't get into it, nor do I appreciate all the stuff it ""borrows"" from - not just counting ""PT&A"" - without any credit whatsoever.,negative";Movie
Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty disappointing (but then, I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and mercifully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film.,negative;Movie
"Many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, however, every so often a movie might come along thats honest, funny, entertaining AND memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients. This film follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David ""The Big Apple"") misadventures into the world of first-time sex and true love. Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow hopeless romantic Gary (The main character) on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it's ending. If you haven't been lucky enough to see this movie yet, by all means take a look...sprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace. L.A.V. truly is an original film, a rarity among films of it's genre.,positive";Movie
I loved this show from it's first airing, and I always looked forward to watching each episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special affects were outstanding! Then the sci-fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining, well written show. I say bring it back, I know all of the actors would come back. I would suggest buying the DVD's, I am. I hope the sci-fi channels executives get word of these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I only watch one show on that channel now, (Ghost Hunters), but I am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too.,positive;Movie
I didn't know what to except so I think it was a lot better not having excepted much. Don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. You can tell that it has been an act of love for her. The acting (outside of Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. There was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though I don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I say go for it. The gag reel was fun, I won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the DVD worth it just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the film then check out The Pink Mirror, a film also done by Jagged Edge. I know fans of Dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.,positive;Movie
Did the first travesty actually make money? This is another sequel (along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT) that no one asked for. But we've received it anyway. The sequel is like its predecessor, completely brain-dead. It's also pretty disgusting (remember the dinner scene?) To think I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck, and Warden. Did they need the money that much?,negative;Movie

"This movie is awesome on so many levels... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.<br /><br />Just remember this: When you're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies... be they good or bad... THIS is the formula that they are using. THIS is what makes zombie movies so great.<br /><br />And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.<br /><br />All in all, it doesn't linger. There's never a point where you think to yourself ""c'mon, get on with it""... it moves quick and corners nicely. This is the sporty, little Italian number of zombie flicks.<br /><br />So awful, it's wonderful! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek... rent it, buy it, love it.<br /><br />As a great trivia note: If you're watching it on DVD, you'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen, underneath the musical score... Well... that's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop.,positive";Movie
"The Ladies Man is laugh out loud funny, with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written).<br /><br />Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role.<br /><br />Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there.<br /><br />It is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round.<br /><br />I am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4.7 /10 and i urge you to vote! <br /><br />And remember kids- ""Theres more motion in the ocean"",positive";Movie
when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like The Duchess(2008), but when i saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria i knew this wouldn't just be a solid movie. Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot.<br /><br />The only thing that really let me down are the performances. Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable.<br /><br />To me the film feels like unfinished. Maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script, i don't know but that's how i feel about the movie.<br /><br />But overall it's a great movie about the early years of Victoria with a Great performance from Emily Blunt.,positive;Movie
A flying saucer manned (literally) by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a 'forbidden planet.' What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth, a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman, and her father, a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in.<br /><br />On the surface, this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery. Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its The Tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? <br /><br />Underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek.<br /><br />Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.<br /><br />This is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi I like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it. <br /><br />Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film). Walter Pigeon, though quite excellent in other films, over-acts his role as well. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the amazing Robby the Robot are the stand-out actors in this crowd, though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job. The problems with the featured performances, I think, are as much the fault of the director and the editor, as anything. Though they certainly got most of the film quite right.,positive;Movie
"I just saw this film on DVD last night, and decided to check out the reviews this morning. It seems that ""I, Robot"" has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb (and given rise to a lot of insults and name-calling, too).<br /><br />I find this somewhat surprising, as this film is not great (or even good), but neither is it terrible (or even really bad). What this film really is, is...depressing. Depressing that the US film-goer population is so ready to lap up insipid, clichéd re-heats, and acclaim them as spectacular new works. This film as ""retread"" written all over it, from the plot line (an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern-day uber-action) to Smith's character (a smart-mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium), to the special effects (that borrowed from Matrix and a few others).<br /><br />""I, Robot"" is, sadly, quite possibly the perfect action movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialog, and lots and lots of adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we already knew that (he seems to be Hollywood's latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis). The story has lots of holes in it, of all sizes, but I don't think most people drawn to this film are critically-minded enough to notice. Perhaps a blockbuster by today's standards, but very B-movie compared to true winners.,negative";Movie
This was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects. Just tell a true story about the struggles of two African American women over a turbulent century.<br /><br />This movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc.<br /><br />Good movie with a good message.,positive;Movie
I have bought the complete season of Surface. watched it in 3 days! I was so captured by the the plot, theories and basically everything about this show. The actor who plays Miles is great. Mile's sister, mother and father acted like real life family would. You could connect on so many levels it's fascinating.<br /><br />I find animals are so wonderful, you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child. It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists.<br /><br />Am sadden, that Surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book.<br /><br />Love the show very much. For those who haven't watched Surface, if you like sci-fi you need to watch this!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive;Movie
"This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />I have to disagree with another commenter, who said the special effects were okay. I found them pretty bad: it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story.<br /><br />Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for ""the set"". They do not bother to tell what set, or what is so special about it. That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California, while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt.<br /><br />If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, take the effort to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert.<br /><br />The action-level was constant throughout the movie, no ups and downs, no climax. It made the movie look short, and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie.,negative";Movie
"Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent as his wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love undying. They need each other. Tim Roth as the evil Cunningham is perfect; in one way or another, upon watching the movie, you will find Cunningham disgusting. The Scotland scenery is beautiful. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well. If you like history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it's unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes. It's their skill as actors that attracts you, they don't rely on marquee names, popularity or sex symbol appeal. This is something special.,positive";Movie
"When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. She has beautiful and charming body. When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body... i think male have hard to resist....i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queen.I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions aren't conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry for that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh.

"Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied... I faced a need for critical opinion, which I generally don't like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer. There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally. But when I read the reviews already written on this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes don't know what to criticize. Therefore, to be clear, I'll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably: the former one about Visconti before his director's career and latter one about Visconti the director. <br /><br />The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that young Luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. His effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents' divorce. We also get a very accurate idea of where Luchino was brought up as a real count of Milano: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. For instance, his father's splendid villa at Grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that. There is also an emphasis on Visconti's crucial visit in Paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people (""left wingers"") who later had impact on his style and message in art. That clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing (a contrast at first sight). <br /><br />However, the part about his director's career, which started with OSSESSIONE during WWII and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. His movies are not discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the works on LA TERRA TREMA and that is all right. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, such movies like IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE A VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I did not like the interviews of his. Moreover, some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary... There is no mention of significant works of Visconti like CONVERSATION PIECE, there are no interviews with eminent cast Burt Lancaster. A mention about Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider should also be made. There is one footage interview with Maria Callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit. Franco Zeffirelli, though I appreciate him as a director, makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious. For instance, he mentions the event how Visconti separated from him after years of service. Therefore, I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /><br />What I find a strong point here are footage interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we may get his own opinion about his works. For instance, I very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming LUDWIG.<br /><br />I believe it is better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani than this doc. Although it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will get a better idea of the director. Visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people's emotions and viewpoints into stone... 4/10,negative";Movie
"Time is precious. This film isn't. I must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time.<br /><br />The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: Is this the film the critics are raving about? What a piece of crap!<br /><br />The hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. Get it?<br /><br />The acting is superb.<br /><br />The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. The characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next.<br /><br />I have had more fun doing the laundry.,negative";Movie

"Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. Not only that the storyline and script was wretched. I don't know why this movie was made. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood boil. The situations were inane at best. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to not recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.,negative";Movie
I have to say this is my favorite movie of all time. I have seen it well over 100 times (actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching) It is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in.

I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I'm going to assume that one's level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one's level of acceptance of Joseph's story.<br /><br />However, that aside it was very well made, well acted, and had a nice score. If you get to Salt Lake City, it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater. I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality, sound quality and ambiance in my entire life...I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there! Being that I'm LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet, I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times...which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started! Anyway, I'm told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe, if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells a fascinating story.,positive;Movie
"Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. Sound like anyone you know?<br /><br />From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.<br /><br />The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.<br /><br />In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All this does is to humanise him. When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.<br /><br />In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face, ""your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people""? And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).<br /><br />Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. ""Gee, ain't I cute?"" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over. Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature. The 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.<br /><br />Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.<br /><br />And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?,negative";Movie
"""Milo"" is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.Do we really need more slashers?I for one think we already have more than enough.I guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that's also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.A long time ago,he drowned but that didn't bother him and he still kills people(""Friday the 13th"",what's that?).One day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,Milo comes to pay them a visit.Through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milo's dull,I mean dark secret.She and her friends have been dying to know.Once discovered,Milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn't it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.The acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him that,but some movies just can't be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.,negative";Movie
This is one of the best horror / suspense films that Hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades.Even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts, it has everything that a good film in this genre should had CHILL, THRILLS, AND yes a lot of GORE!! HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS!!! In parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,I have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way!,positive;Movie
"Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's ""The Town the Dreaded Sundown"".,negative";Movie
Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed his name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature Mickey, it is in fact his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable. The story sees Mickey piloting a steamboat until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up cargo, and Minnie Mouse missing the boat. Being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her crank it's tail and play the tune, and getting some other animals to be percussion, until Pete comes along again to stop him, making Mickey peel potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!,positive;Movie
Highly regarded at release, but since rather neglected. Immense importance in the history of performing arts. A classic use of embedded plots. One of my favourite films. Why hasn't the soundtrack been re-released?,positive;Movie
"The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old ""Santa kills"" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions. Not one of the show's highlights.,negative";Movie
The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film. It should have read 'Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family's church at 8 years old, listening to the preacher drone on about God's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned, building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny's 'how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast?' moment. It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree, sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic-induced babble. I believe I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end. After the 31st, I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym, 'prey'. Sadly, this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes. Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) as it became totally zany. Indeed, even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8-10 stars, I suggest sticking with your theology-reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia, Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the soon-to-be released Religulous.<br /><br />Maybe Robert Whitlow's book is better.,negative;Movie
"TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is possibly the best movie of all of Mary Pickford's films. At two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. Mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a ""greatest hits"" performance with bits of Mary the innocent, Mary the little devil, Mary the little mother, Mary the spitfire, Mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. The movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary is thought the unwed mother in question! If the Academy Awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the Best Actress Oscar for the year would have been Mary's.,positive";Movie
I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $5 on VHS. She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.,negative;Movie
Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well-developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />Although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to--very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. For example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80's, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. Inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not-so-metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. None of that is in here.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is hardly in the category of anti-drug propaganda. It is mostly an interesting neutrally-presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana, LSD, heroin, cocaine, MDMA, and Oxycontin. But there is a significant element of various people's points of view with regard to drug laws, and most (but not all) of that is not very thoughtful or well-informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality, especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana. <br /><br />The criminal justice system, along with its often harsh life-ruining penalties, is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem, but unfortunately there's an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs, a lack of compassion for fellow humans, a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally-approved, perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison/policing industry, and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity. It's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so, and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason. This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs, yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />So, in sum, the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining. But when it comes to presenting a rational non-radical point of view with regard to drug policy, and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives, it's pretty disappointing.,negative;Movie
"Considering this film was released 8 years before I was born, I don't feel too bad for over-looking it for such a long time. Back in January of 98 though, I attended the Second Annual Quentin Tarantino film fest held in Austin,Texas. The particular theme of films this night was ""Neglected 70's Crime Films"" and boy was her right. ""The Gravy Train(or The Dion Brothers, as it appeared this print)"" was an absolute gem. Wonderful performances, quirky characters, smart plot, hilarious comedy, and just an all around great time. Rarely do you see a Crime film that is so entertaining and fresh. Margot Kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well. I hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it. In the meantime, go to an indie video store and hope they have it.,positive";Movie
"The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then.,positive";Movie
"First, I realize that a ""1"" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it's not bad in a self-aware, over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply misses its mark on every count. **Contains possible spoilers** The dialog is completely disingenuous. The continuity is so deliberate it's painful. Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love, and with his final word the flamenco dancers start. The mock-shock of what's her name (see? I don't even remember her character's name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. Vegetable carts gone flying. Cars crashing into each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People nearly being hit, but remarkably, no one is. Oh, that's right... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times, is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there. Hmmm. <br /><br />It's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing. Now there's a novel idea. <br /><br />My suggestion: don't see this film. Don't rent the DVD. Don't watch it on cable. There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied.,negative";Movie
"Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says ""lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black, then walk away"". The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is funny, and the show contains many such types of situation, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of the humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier. Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers? I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers, divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all.,negative";Movie
"The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H. G. Wells' great novel, ""War of the Worlds"". This is perhaps the least well-known and very probably the best of them. No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th Century, 1900  using Wells' original setting, in and near Woking, England.<br /><br />IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as ""spoilers"". That might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature, so let's get right to the chase. The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease, against which they have no immunity. If that's a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.<br /><br />This film, which follows Wells' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented  in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th Century photography. Although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). Colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. At other times, colors are washed out. These variations are typical of early films, which didn't use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality, even going from black/white to sepia/white to blue/white to reddish/white and so on  as you'll see on occasion here. The special effects are deliberately retrograde, of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s  and yet the Martians and their machines are very much as Wells described them and have a more nearly realistic ""feel"". Some of effects are really awkward  such as the destruction of Big Ben. The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours. Some aspects of Victorian dress may appear odd, particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair.<br /><br />This film is the only one that follows with some closeness Wells' original narrative  as has been noted. Viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story. Wells' description of the Martians  a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles  is effectively portrayed. When the Martian machines appear, about an hour into the film, they too give a good impression of how Wells described them. Both Wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the Martians from the limited perspective (primarily) of rural England  plus a few scenes in London (involving the Narrator's brother). The director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark (Big Ben), but at least doesn't dwell unduly on the devastation of London.<br /><br />The victory of the Martians is hardly a surprise, despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines. The Narrator, traveling about to seek escape, sees much of what Wells terms ""the rout of Mankind"". He encounters a curate endowed with the Victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality. They eventually find themselves on the very edge of a Martian nest, where they discover an awful fact: the Martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene. Wells adds that after eating they set up ""a prolonged and cheerful hooting"". The Narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate  who revives just as the Martians drag him off to the larder (cheers from the gallery; British curates are so often utterly insufferable).<br /><br />This film lasts almost 3 hours, going through Wells' story in welcome detail. It's about time the author got his due  in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact. A word about the acting: Don't expect award-winning performances. They're not bad, however, the actors are earnest and they grow on you. Most of them, however, have had very abbreviated film careers, often only in this film. The Narrator is played by hunky Anthony Piana, in his 2nd film. The Curate is John Kaufman  also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing. The Brother (""Henderson"") is played with some conviction by W. Bernard Bauman in his first film. The Artilleryman, the only other sizable part, is played by James Lathrop in his first film.<br /><br />This is overall a splendid film, portraying for the first time the War of the Worlds as Wells wrote it. Despite its slight defects, it is far and away better than any of its hyped-up competitors. If you want to see H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds  and not some wholly distorted version of it  see this film!,positive";Movie
Of the elements that make this the best at this point, I have to say #1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent. I imagine that, as one poster suggested, Christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene, but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil, to be smiling at Shemp's possibly dying.<br /><br />Another character who helps this stand out is the Goon. His look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof-ball. Hardly a character I would choose to meet in a dark alley or, for that matter anywhere. I would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, who's going to complain. Not I.,positive;Movie

Anyway this movie made no sense what-so ever,it was extremelly dull,the characters were highly one dimensional,Freddy was another joker,which is very stupid for such a good series.The plot is very,very bad,and this is even worse than part 2 and 5. I didnt get the movie,its a stupid tale in 3-d,pointless!Id say. I hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film.This is SO different than the prequels,it tries,and tries,but this one tried the hardest,and got slapped back on the face.Again there were hadly any death scenes,although they were different,they sucked bigtime.

"Everyone, my name may sound weird, but there was nothing else! <br /><br />Any way, I haven't seen anything like this before so it was crazy! Of course that's a good thing. It is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one! Like chicken little,, the fish pretending to be King Kong and Runt the pig saying, ""Twas beauty who killed the beast"", War of the worlds scene and more. Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one. Also, how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /><br />However some parts don't fit. Like in the original lion king, weren't Timon and Pumbaa with Simba when he beat Scar? In this movie, they are not! they were fighting the hyenas backstage. Ther's more, the reason being why Pumbaa isn't so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also, it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anybody realise that only Timonn's story was told, whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks?<br /><br />But apart from that , IT""S GREAT!,positive";Movie
"Finally was there released a good Modesty Blaise movie, which not only tells a story, but actually tells the ""real"" story. I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller, but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations. Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O'Donnell. You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is. It is not a movie to attract new fans, but a movie to tell the real tale. Some things could have been better, but when you cannot forget the awful movie from '66 then is this a magnificent movie.

"I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog  and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.<br /><br />The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that cliché? Marry in haste, repent at leisure... <br /><br />In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with John's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, John's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.<br /><br />How many more clichéd situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate.<br /><br />This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn  during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />So, it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative  all against the backdrop of the ""average"" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /><br />And, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938  soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many here would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.<br /><br />However, I'm glad I saw it  as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But, I'll have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.,negative";Movie
Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there's nothing to spoil about that movie.Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director. But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it.This film is just empty, nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood(it's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors, no dialogs, just as bad as an 90'T.V film.It's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So Rest in peace Bruno, you will stay in our minds forever anyway, thanks to such unforgettable gems as:Zombi 3, Robowar,Rats, l'altro inferno,Virus, Cruel jaws and few others.So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco's spirit's new film, pass on this one.But if you don't know this nice artisan's career track down his old films and have fun.,negative;Movie

"Hypothetical situations abound, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. One lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. All alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local Indian tribe  until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co-existence. Alan, a man of the book, is left on Earth after an unknown disaster. Thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way  until, Jeri Ryan, appears (like she would in any dream) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, they try to co-exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer  Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. Even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise.<br /><br />Using a variable film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled ""The Quiet Earth"" (which I will be viewing next) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. With a borrowed story, I guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while Ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director's techniques to attempt to find his own. He opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. Sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to ""how"" or better yet ""why"" these select few survived. A spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. The juxtaposition would have been like ""Shawn of the Dead"", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a ""made-for-TV"" program. Listening to the audio commentary, I have respect for Ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made, and his passion nearly sells the film, but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn't as happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes, ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out. While this does make for decent independent film-making, it sometimes feels cheap, and in Ralston's case, it was the latter.<br /><br />I must admit, David Arnott's portrayal of Alan hooked me. He played that wimpy, school nerd, adult role very well. He was funny to both watch and listen to, and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together, alas, I cannot say the same for the rest. This was Dan Montgomery's first film, and it was obvious  I mean  really really obvious. There were scenes in which I thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him, perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance, but alas, it wasn't the case. Then there was Jeri Ryan. She pulled into her character near the end of the film, which to me, was the culmination of the entire piece of art. She goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end. Confused? Again, she fell into her character by the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured. Even as the commentary progressed, all that she contributed was a laugh, giggle, or ""ohhh, look at that color"" moment. While her beauty may sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful. This was her first film, so can I be too harsh? <br /><br />Overall, this film felt like it was missing something. I though the idea was strong  the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the Earth the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (maybe because it is consumed by zinc?) and we as a race will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are flawed and pre-used, but he does know how to make a low-budget comedy. I think our idea of ""funny"" is different, so that is why I couldn't find myself laughing at many of the bits he found ""hysterical"". His actors provided the level of acting needed for this film, which was lower than average. His film was loose, meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled (i.e. anything with wings survived?!?), which overall harmed the intensity of the film. This was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much much funnier. For those thinking that Roger Avery was a huge element to this film, as we learn from their commentary, all he was there for was money  the was in essence, the bank for ""The Last Man"". Don't get your hopes up for any classic Avery moments.<br /><br />Don't expect more from Ralston  and that is how I will end it.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****,negative";Movie
<br /><br />I must admit, I was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of 'Cut' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem. I am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found 'Cut' to not only be the best of the genre Australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody/comedy films of late.<br /><br />My only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in EVERY possible cliche of the horror genre they could. I am certain this was intended as humour....hoping this was intended as humour.<br /><br />And of course, there was the gore.<br /><br />The use of the 'customised' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. In short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth.<br /><br />The appearance of both Kylie Minogue (short that her appearance was) and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as Simon Bossell ('The Castle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician.<br /><br />All in all, I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.<br /><br />Loved it. Go see it!,positive;Movie
I am so happy not to live in an American small town. Because whenever I'm shown some small town in the States it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. In this movie a former doctor, who's just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the Purgatory Flats. And, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. He meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. But there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small-time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. To know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. I'll just tell you that it's slightly reminiscent of U Turn by Oliver Stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.,positive;Movie
"Like anyone else who bought this, I was duped by the ""20 pieces of extreme gore"" and ""banned in 20 countries"" or whatever it says in the box. I have to admit I am a huge gore fan and I am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the business. The revolutionized make-up effects in the 80's. Today, you don't need them as everything is done on computer. But computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. But I digress.<br /><br />Watching fantastically gory films like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's crowning achievement, Friday the 13th the Final Chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. You can't tell the difference between reality and magic.<br /><br />I can't imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. If that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. You don't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords.<br /><br />The gore? Well, it's here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. A man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping; there is nothing really much else to this film. The scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but I was expecting a bit more. Call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? I honestly found myself bored in a lot of places.<br /><br />Cannibal Ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. While Cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe. If you go out of your way to buy this for $20.00, you will feel cheated.<br /><br />3/10,negative";Movie
I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. Familiar to millions as the Lt. on Law and Order, she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases, always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny, successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna, New York, a suburb of Buffalo.<br /><br />The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50's and 60's from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem. But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny's boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people, played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black, except for Jimmy Smits, of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day.,positive;Movie
"This will not likely be voted best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, gone is the wooden James Bond (a role he was wasted in). If he can maintain this kind of quality I hope he continues to make comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man. I've read a few negative comments in here about Hope Davis but I thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within. There are lots of good chuckles as Brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where I nearly died laughing. My father (a consultant) nearly lost it when Julian describes himself as a ""facilitator"". Much like ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", another hit-man comedy, the humour can be very dark. If you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself.,positive";Movie
As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones, I thought this might be interesting. Not so, as this film is very 'of its age', in the 1960's. To me (someone born in the 1980's) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap, but I am sure this film was not made for me, but people who were active during th '60's. I expected drugs galore with th Stones, I was disappointed, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing, sort of 'amatuerish' which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value. My only good opinion of this is that I didn't waste money on it, it came free with a Sunday paper.,negative;Movie
Watch the Original with the same title from 1944! This made for TV movie, is just god-awful! Although it does use (as far as I can tell) almost the same dialog, it just doesn't work! Is it the acting, the poor directing? OK so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much, as if you've watched it first! <br /><br />There are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all are for the worse! The actors playing the parts here, just don't fit the bill! You just don't believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original? If you want, only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave, if you watch it through! It's almost sacrilege!,negative;Movie
Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this film. It is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. I didn't know what to expect sitting down to watch this: a civil war movie or some kind of 70's soft-core peddling with Eastwood descending on a school for girls in the South. But really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film's end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin(you'll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for manners headed by Geraldine Page amidst the chaos that was the Civil War - particularly in the South. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely, young seductress Carol, and even Ferdin(Amy)have emotional/sexual ties to Eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. In the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This might be(except for Invasion of the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best film. It certainly is one of Eastwood's best REAL performances. page is always so very good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al excellent. the Gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexual-laced scenes disturbing. And what happens to Eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film.,positive;Movie
"Anyone who lived through the ages of Revenge of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this film. It is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a ""spring break movie"" PLUS it makes fun of the college film genre. It's funny, it's got a cast to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Writer/ actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a great villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I'm just repeating myself now...) It will live on with girls who like Miranda July but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they're dumb.,positive";Movie
"Arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura(now she's a car!). This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. We get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond's phenom comic strip. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a Shakespeare troupe by any means, but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as Flash. He is ably aided by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts Crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us Professor Zarkov((Frank Shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack ""Tiny"" Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. Lipson steals each and every scene he is in. The plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow. Excellent!,positive";Movie
I have to say that the events of 9/11 didn't hit me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers. I was sick of hearing about it. When this was aired on TV a year and a day later, I was bawling my eyes out. It was the first time I had cried since the attack. I highly recommend this documentary. I am watching it now on TV, 5 years later, and I am still crying over the tragedies. The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. It was an accident, and look where it got them. These two brothers make me want to have been there to help.,positive;Movie
Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite films tend to have flaws - Rear Window looks a little stagey at times, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the music score in Best Years of Our Lives is too cheesy, the beginning of Nights of Cabiria is a little too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /><br />The script is brilliant, the acting is superb all around (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are amazing, the whole cast shines), the directing and the photography are inspired, and the music score is touching without being intrusive (like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment is truly moving, every light moment makes me smile. This truly is one of the best films I have ever seen and I wish there were more films like it. <br /><br />I am glad that Reese Witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film, but I am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.,positive;Movie
This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57. But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. Just a few of the awful moments in the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. When on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, HUH!! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!,negative;Movie
regardless of what anyone says, its a b-movie, and the effects are poorly done.. if you're a vampire fanatic, I suppose it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, you others here cant sincerely mean that?. we are to view this as a movie, not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. The story are good, but it doesn't carry the film, no wonder it has a low rating over all. I write this because I chose to see this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb, but got severely disappointed. don't get me wrong, I thought the blade movies was awesome, and loved the underworld movies, but this characters aren't close. the make up on the vampires is poorly done, and the effects are worse. this sucks. I might not have gotten so disappointed if I had not read reviews here that told me how great it was. the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think this is awesome, you don't care about acting or make up. this is better as a book. 3 out of 10 for an OK story..,negative;Movie
"I want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that I have to conclude Carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can't be bothered letting anyone in on the joke.<br /><br />Some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style (e.g., David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story (e.g., Krzysztof Kieslowski, and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre works). In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.<br /><br />Not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's 'Factory' of the '60s?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. And, even well into middle-age, Cathering Deneuve shows that she still has 'it'. Her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn't sink into bathos.<br /><br />There was an earlier time when I would regard such films as ""Pola X"" more charitably. Experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment doesn't work. But Carax tries nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of movie-viewing and literally thousands of films later, I simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal, poorly crafted tripe. At this early moment in the 21st century, one is left asking: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there *any* directors in France who know how to make a watchable movie anymore?

"It's hard to praise this film much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow. Also, the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious.<br /><br />I was amazed to see ""Marcus Aurelius"" in the acting credits, wondering what an ex-Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film! Like ""Whoopie Goldberg"" it must be an alias, and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker.<br /><br />The story might been interesting, but the acting is flat, and direction is tedious. If you MUST watch this film, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so - then it'll be enjoyable.,negative";Movie
"I remember going to see the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and being pretty into it at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time.<br /><br />Right before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie since she had never seen it and I was feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />Ralph Bakshi ran out of money about mid-way through the animation process for this movie, and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this is saying something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them.<br /><br />Because of budget constraints, the movie -- already a compression of ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" and part of ""The Two Towers"" -- was pared down even more. What you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the Cliff Notes of the books.<br /><br />Its not all bad, though, the animation brings a warmth to it, that I found lacking in the Jackson movies. Its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding.<br /><br />This movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came. Several years later, a half-hearted half-hour long TV special was aired, which was meant to wrap things up. All I will say about that is that it was a musical.,negative";Movie
Just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much I actually went to see it on opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it get screwed up. I really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and Matthew McConaughey. First off I am not a MM hater, I thought he was awesome in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3-4 times. Yes we all get it that he a good-looking guy with a nice body, but I think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let's get into his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. I know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner, but his lines were corny and cheesy. It was almost like he was referencing Days and Confused lines a few times! In short, I didn't like his character even though I was supposed to. The accent, his shirt off, corny pick up lines, weak sales pitches. His character was just too much of a tool, as Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were great, but that' no surprise. Piven is fun to watch as Arie....oooops I mean Jerry. I just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly. It's insulting that they could take a great story, and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success. 1. Cool story that appeals to the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for female women (make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes, and 25 great one liners 3. Every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven to play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Throw in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Plot, good writing, character development, and intelligent casting are unnecessary<br /><br />This will be good enough for most people, but not me! Anybody who disagrees with me, ask your self this. Would this movie be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. DeCaprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM<br /><br />I will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks. I realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of Pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing Russo. The financial success of this movie will ensure one thing. The movie going public gets what the movie going public wants, big budget crapola.,negative;Movie

I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts, and to be honest, I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest, simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film, for me was Evie's rather colourful poem. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. In my opinion, watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also striking, especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable, I strongly disagree with,positive;Movie
"For Greta Garbo's first talking picture, MGM wisely chose Eugene O'Neill's Pultizer Prize winning 1921 play ANNA Christie. <br /><br />Also wisely, the producers backed Garbo up with not one but two members of the Original Broadway Cast (George Marion as Anna's father, Chris, and James T. Mack as Johnny the Priest - transmuted to ""Johnny the Harp"" for films so as not to offend). <br /><br />This little change is interesting. Like too many films accused (by those who want MOVIES to be MOVIES and ignore their origins) of being ""little more than filmed stage plays,"" the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn't be more faithful to the property. By diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn't offend anyone, or opening it up because they COULD, too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place. <br /><br />Fortunately, the respect the studio had for both O'Neill and Garbo allowed ANNA Christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in Frances Marion's generally sensitive screen adaptation. Wonder of wonders, Marion even allows the POINT of the scene where Garbo's Anna reveals her past on ""the farm"" to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact! What the League of Decency must have thought of that! <br /><br />The source play's greatest problem has always been that Chris's friend Marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that Anna can take stage - the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don't always recognize. <br /><br />The perfectly cast Marie Dressler (who had cut her teeth on the Broadway stage as well before going to Hollywood) is the perfect balance for Garbo's Anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes, doesn't allow us too much time to miss her - one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original - AND screenwriter Marion is wise enough to stray from O'Neill to bring Dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of Julie Laverne's second act appearance in SHOW BOAT. <br /><br />Anna and Marthy's early scene together on screen (16 minutes into the film) taking each other's measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece. Not to be missed. <br /><br />ANNA Christie is great tragic play and a good film drama. It's hard to imagine that a latter day remake, which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake (it was first filmed without sound in 1923 - also with George Marion's original Broadway Chris) could improve on this excellent filming. <br /><br />The internal scenes hew closest to the play, but the exteriors shouldn't be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere. While the background screen work is not to modern technical standards, the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set (especially in the New York harbor).<br /><br />Nearly all Garbo's naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly (only the too often parodied death scene from CAMILLE, 7 years later, will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies), but this ANNA Christie, together with the variety of her 1932 films, MATA HARI and GRAND HOTEL, and the sublime Lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy, NINOTCHKA (""Garbo laughs!""), surely stand as her best.<br /><br />O'Neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded ""sea plays,"" should track down the fine World War II shaped film released in the year before the U.S. entered the conflict, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940). It is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from ANNA Christie, and features a youngish John Wayne in one of his rare non-Westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way.,positive";Movie
"Let me set the scene. It is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We look for a movie that is starting soon and ""The Grinch"" comes up. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun.<br /><br />Jim Carrey (who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought this childhood movie to life.<br /><br />The story is based upon the story of the grinch. As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. But one little girl is going to change The Grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way.<br /><br />Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. She attempts to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.<br /><br />All up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim.<br /><br />,positive";Movie
"As a long-time fan of all the Star Trek series,I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of ""flashbacks"" featuring Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crewmate's death)was a money-saving device, as were many of their ""bottle shows"" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur(who also appeared at least twice on the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) also were shortchanged. This was the last episode of second season; thus, the season ended ""not with a bang"" but with ""a whimper."",negative";Movie
This TV-series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid. Even though I see it now through the pink-shaded glasses of nostalgia, I can still tell it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. I have not seen the original French version, only the Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long ago to remember.<br /><br />The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, school still hasn't taught me half of what I know from this show. It also tied in other things, like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don't exercise, with nice examples within the body. Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you? :D The cartoon looked nice, very kids friendly of course, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electric signals in the brain, antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures, looking pretty much how you'd expect what they should look like in the animated body.<br /><br />This, and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale) were key parts of my childhood. I'm so happy I found them here.,positive;Movie
"Fans of the HBO series ""Tales From the Crypt"" are going to love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic EC comics were based on, will recognize this one right off the bat.<br /><br />Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screenplays for APARTMENT ZERO and DEATH BECOMES HER) is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way. He could play a really nice if misunderstood guy-next-door, or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness. In the case of RIGHT TO DIE, he takes the latter approach, and it definitely works.<br /><br />Donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist (Robin Sydney), much to the displeasure of his inconsolable, unforgiving spouse, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of ""making up,"" and she's horribly burned in a fire, he's reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy (Corbin Bernsen, looking the worse for wear these days.) <br /><br />But Abbey's never been one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC-theme of the episode comes in. Cuckolded husbands - and wives - have always been the genre's favorite subject matter for some spooky (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is definitely no exception. If anything, the ramped-up quotient of sex and gore must have Bill Gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere.<br /><br />And that's not to mention that John Esposito's original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist. You don't realize as you're watching that you only know half the story, until close to the end...(think WHAT LIES BENEATH with more guts and gazongas, and you're there.)<br /><br />Not a bad effort, but not the best of the lot, either. At least Rob Schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction, especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed! As with most MOH episodes, this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely squeamish need not apply.,positive";Movie
Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government, and well written T.V. Drama's in the 25 years.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the writing is spectacular.<br /><br />Diry War reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a Nuclear, Biological, and Radiological Terrorist Attack here on American soil.<br /><br />Dirty War should be made into a major motion picture - It's that good! I highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth.<br /><br />This T.V. drama reveals how British Intelligence (MI5 & MI6) attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims -because of England's involvement in the Iraq War.<br /><br />The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular.<br /><br />Dirty War is a must see!!!,positive;Movie
Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn't have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around Adam's inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack.

"This is the Who at their most powerful. Although before the masterwork Who's Next, which would provide anthems like Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again. This film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the 70's.<br /><br />Daltrey shows what being a front-man is all about, Entwistle steady as ever. <br /><br />Moon is great, check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech, and see him playing ""side saddle"" whilst having a bass drum head replaced!<br /><br />Townsend even looks like he's enjoying himself occasionally!<br /><br />Considering they took to the stage at 2am no one in the crowd was asleep! <br /><br />There are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in 36 years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one.,positive";Movie
"This filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell -- and did so. Really awful jumble of unlikely/unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line, all without character or clear motivation.<br /><br />We get cliché snapshots instead of characters. One in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss, who projects an overdone ""tough guy"" persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her. Nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase (as in, the smallest from a complete American Tourister set) in a bright, sky blue, without explanation or apology. Otherwise it's standard visually -- one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in CT.,negative";Movie
They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?,positive;Movie
That's how Burt Reynolds describes this film, which happens to be his best ever. He plays Tom Sharky, a vice detective who's on the trail of an international mobster (Vittorio Gassman) and the man he's financing to be the next governor of Georgia (Earl Holliman). In the novel by William Diehl, the story is more complex because the guy's running for president. This is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two. The filming in downtown Atlanta and the Peachtree Plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story. Reynolds doesn't do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films. He's very serious here, especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong. At times though, the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with Burt trying to get close to the mobster's woman. Only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax. Just like the great jazz score in DIRTY HARRY by Lalo Schifrin, Sharky's Machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including Chet Baker, Julie London, Flora Purim & Buddy De Franco, The Manhattan Transfer, Doc Severinson, Sarah Vaughan and Joe Williams. Al Capps handles the score with magic. This movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever. Check it out.<br /><br />Score, 8 out of 10 Stars,positive;Movie
Human Traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends, it is a fly-on-the-wall view into their lives (and minds) which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other. There are many moments in that every one can relate to, Like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers. The characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie. The situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in, and that is where this film succeeds. The topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other. The story to the film is not all that, but that is not a criticism. This is a film about people. This is a well written film, with a sound track to die for. D.J's Pete Tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that I have seen in 1999. After watching this film I felt like I had been out partying all weekend. Fantastic Movie! Jo Brand as the voice of reality - Need I say more!<br /><br />,positive;Movie
"This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch. The second on disc one of D.W. Griffith's ""Years of Discovery"" DVD set (highly recommended) it features three excellent performances by the main leads, and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Birth of a Nation) as a campy musician giving a Countess the eye (and other things).<br /><br />The Countess' husband goes berserk at his wife's betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour. It's kind of incredible that they wouldn't hear the wall going up, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of silent player Raymond Hackett) gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama, but in an unexpectedly comical way. The best moment comes at the end. As the lady passes out from shock and fear, once she realizes she's doomed, Henry picks up his instrument and ""fans"" it over her. The way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it, and laughed my head off. The expression on his face! From that moment I was charmed by Henry B. Walthall.,positive";Movie
Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie which caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred. Soon after its release, he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably. Its a very bad movie with horrible acting, bad-quality makeup and pathetic screenplay. Throughout the movie, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theatre. The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission. Sorry, I'll not recommend this one to anyone.,negative;Movie
"Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word ""f--k"" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.<br /><br />Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!,positive";Movie
"First, the CGI in this movie was horrible. I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. At the end when the owner of the park gets killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation.<br /><br />That said, the movie had almost no plot. Why were they on that island in particular? Well, it wasn't stated in the movie. And, why would the people keep coming into the cat's area? Makes no sense.<br /><br />One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting. In what could be called a ""B made for TV movie"" movie, the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday, watch this movie. It may be good for some memorable quotes.,negative";Movie
I enjoyed it. There you go, I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think), delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions, this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works.<br /><br />Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.,positive;Movie

"Although it strays away from the book a little, you can't help but love the atmospheric music and settings.<br /><br />The scenes in Bath are just how they should be. Although if you have watched it as many times as I have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene, but that aside, I like the scene where they are in the Hot Baths, but did the men and women really bathe together like that? You could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women. It also seemed strange that they all had their hats on, but perhaps this was the style at the time. The ballroom scenes were very nice, the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful. I especially liked Catherine's dress in the first ballroom scene.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey looked suitably imposing, but I enjoyed the Bath scenes better.<br /><br />Schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as Catherine Morland. Googie Withers gives the best performance as Mrs Allen I feel.<br /><br />Ugh Peter Firth as Mr Tilney, he just talks a load of rubbish, and is not a clergyman as he should be, it's hard to think of him being in love with Catherine, but then the book never really gave that impression either.<br /><br />General Tilney is played reasonably well by Hardy, and Stuart also gives a sort of good performance as Isabella. Ingrid Lacey did not give a good performance as Elinor Tilney. As for John Thorpe, well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man, perhaps not the character portrayed in the book, but I quite like it.<br /><br />I can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation, but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me. The marchioness! I hate her. She is not part of the Northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy.<br /><br />some of the script is peculiar. When Catherine is asking Elinor Tilney about her Mothers death she asks ""I suppose you saw the body? How did it appear?"" What a silly thing to say!

A lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to China. Captures the amazement of film's first audiences pretty much as it's described to have been worldwide, and uses actual Lumiere films for most of the actualities. I don't agree with other people about bad acting on the British fellow's part - I thought he was fine, but the Chinese lead really stole the show. In any case, I found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie. People who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in English (which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the Chinese on the DVD).,positive;Movie
"Sigh. I'm baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style, and the story that goes nowhere. And we got the ""joke"" about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time, alright?<br /><br />But I guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE, THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker?

"Cute idea... salesgirl Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a teeny tiny little county of Lampidorra. That country, which wasn't even in North America, was made the 49th state... (of course, there were only 48 states at the time, since this was made in 1952...) Linda travels to the country she has inherited, and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people. At one point, she sings a song that she claims is from her people the Navajo, and it gets ever-more sillier from there.... although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and omni-present smile never get ruffled or shmeared. There are other songs scattered through-out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or some such equivalent, about the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject Tony Craig, cheese vendor. Bogarde made a big splash in the UK film industry after serving in the war, and was even knighted by QE II. Craig and ""the new princess"" keep bumping into each other, and their adventures become more intertwined as Lampidorra's financial problems worsen...

"Back in 1982 a little film called MAKING LOVE shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men.<br /><br />I have been waiting for years for a good, old-fashioned romance between two men; LATTER DAYS is all that and more.<br /><br />Yes, it is soapy, melodramatic, cliché-ridden, and quite corny. That is what makes it so wonderful. There is nothing like a good romantic movie, and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word.<br /><br />As to the issue of religion, sorry folks, but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now. It is not just the Mormon church that rejects its gay members. Gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection.<br /><br />I loved this movie.

"The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious. It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics, from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending. It's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless, so it works for the movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good. Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences, which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed.

This movie came as a huge disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain, but I expected Shamballa to tie up all the loose ends. Unfortunately, it didn't. It added more plot holes than it resolved, and confused more than it clarified. The animation and voice acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, dull setting (most of the movie doesn't even take place in dull WWII Earth rather than the Alchemy world), and disappointing ending (Ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy, and he ditches Winry?), it was altogether pretty lackluster. Do yourself a favor-- disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie, and read the manga.,negative;Movie
"Maybe I loved this movie so much in part because I've been feeling down in the dumps and it's such a lovely little fairytale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I've been for a while.<br /><br />It is a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled.

They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station. They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived. You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot, four young boys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice over narration. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once they're grown, it's easy to spot the writer/director among the four. He's the quiet, contemplative, long-haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants. This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only there's no writing, or directing talent on display here. And if you still can't figure out which one he is, here's a hint: The auteur and his character have the same middle name. It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty-something men were supposed to still be in high school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the warden turned out to be the principal. Once more, the poor, misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement, murder and pillage, but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father. How about hitting back, kid, like you do everyone else? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose. Howlingly bad dialogue. Many scenes badly out of focus. Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras, drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience. Overacting in the extreme. And if you don't quite get the self-important speeches, or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the overbearing music. It will clue you in and what you're supposed to feel. Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies, run over puppies chained to a tree, rob and steal, all the while complaining about their sad, sorry lives. But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college. Yeah, that's the ticket. Why is it that every twenty-something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important, so interesting, that the world can't wait to see it onscreen? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems, then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants.,negative;Movie
"I watched this movie so that you don't have to! I have great respect for Kris Kristofferson, but what was he thinking? He did this for scale? <br /><br />At least the film's title practices truth in advertising, since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film, adding to the confusion. Kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn't sure if Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story!<br /><br />The ""making of"" feature was far more interesting than the movie itself. It explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie, even as the film is being shot.<br /><br />To it's credit, this movie is visually pleasing and doesn't in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over 1M.

The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie's resolution.<br /><br />Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes.<br /><br />If you've seen previews for this movie, then you've seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.,negative";Movie
"I went to see this movie (actually I went to see Family Portraits, which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata festival (Argentina)... I just couldn't watch it! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed. I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun (BTW, of course I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it. I just don't get how you can love that kind of movies! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days!! I also try to analyze the story (my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it) and I just don't think it makes any sense. I mean, that amount of violence and stuff, makes no other sense than to try to shock people. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say ""Well, at least 'x' thing about it was good"". But well, I guess I will never understand that kind of films.,negative";Movie
A well-made run-of-the-mill movie with a tragic ending. Pluses: The way the story moves - begins with Soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he's there. The Music. A disinterested look at the life of policemen. Minuses: The violence and the gore, but I guess they add to the realistic effects. Still, having people's heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided.<br /><br />No complaints - 7/10,positive;Movie
"I don't understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I cannot understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />Cartoon characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do, why should I be expected to care what happens to them? So many reviews keep carping on about how ""realistic"" it is. If that is true, it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film.<br /><br />I didn't like the film at all.,negative";Movie
Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low. It is weird since Steven's last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash. Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn't even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway. As for the action well let's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds. the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes. flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time,negative;Movie
"A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. ""Dressed To Kill"" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own ""Carrie""--not to mention ""Psycho"". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****,negative";Movie
"*Flat SPOILERS* <br /><br />Five med students, Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland), David Labraccio (Kevin Bacon), Rachel Mannus (Julia Roberts), Joe Hurley (William Baldwin) & Randy Steckle (Oliver Platt) decide to attempt an experiment; dying for exactly 5 minutes (it is the maximum amount of time somebody can do this before being risk of brain damage).<br /><br />Almost everyone does this experiment, Randy being the lone exception, but they begin to have unwelcome visitors; David sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him, Joe sees all the women he has had sex with (and which he videotaped) asking him why from the TV Screen, Rachel relives her father's suicide and Nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions.<br /><br />Why are they here? And how will they get rid of them? This tense and interesting movie, set in an hallucinated city and into a Gothic Med School, is quite the experience, both for the story and the characters, played by then-budding stars such as Kiefer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, Oliver Platt, Kevin Bacon and William Baldwin.<br /><br />The director is Joel Schumacher, who had already worked with Sutherland in 'Lost Boys', and this second cooperation is even better than the first.<br /><br />A must for psychological-thriller-horror buds and metaphor lovers (this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs), this is one of the minor classics from the '80s that get respect even today, like the mention by Rebecca Gayheart in 'Scream 2' or the Tru Calling episode which used the movie's premise.<br /><br />Flatliners: 9/10.,positive";Movie
"One of my favorite shows back in the '70s. As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?) here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together.<br /><br />Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.<br /><br />I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. Oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.<br /><br />McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.<br /><br />Definitely deserves a place in TV's ""Hall of Fame"". To quote Tony Vincenzo .... 'Kolchack you are ON IT '... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame,'IN it' !,positive";Movie
"I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish answer to the classic Candid Camera TV show features a Gen X (or is that Gen Y) type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations. Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his ""wedding."" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The ""joke"" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his ""bits and pieces."" Problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking ""Do I look fat?"" I recognize the show was not made for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let them laugh. Thank God the show was short-lived.,negative";Movie
"Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time; and just at the moment you realize you shouldn't be laughing, you've already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness; and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide-open mouths and glazen eyes, you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and... well, you get the point.<br /><br />But for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face, Frownland, really is a remarkable piece of work that, after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps, makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time, you feel sickenly sorry for him.<br /><br />It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein's film, but for some insane reason, I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer. If someone sets you on fire, you typically want to put it out: Stop! Drop! And Roll! But with this film, you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body. You endure the pain--perhaps out of spite, or some unknown masochistic curiosity I can't even begin to attempt to explain.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you. But if you get a chance to catch it, prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag.,positive";Movie
I saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late-night 80's sitcoms on tv one night at 2 in the morning. I must say, I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not Oscar-worthy, to say the least. This movie has its ups and downs, and does have a nice couple of twists at the end, but in all honesty it was awful. Not even a typical slasher movie. No gore, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I'd give it a 3 out of 10.,negative;Movie
"I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK (where it was called ""Laupta: The Flying Island""). I absolutely loved it, and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it. I was enchanted by the story and characters, but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music. It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the ""Streamline Dub"" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney. The voice acting is OK but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the ""streamline"" dub or the original Japanese had, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead. They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from ""Pazu"" to ""Patzu"", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market, homogenized animation.,positive";Movie
"This film can't make up its mind whether its message is ""humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless"" or ""don't ever go in the water again."" A fisherman (Nolan) is out to nab a killer whale, a very bad thing, but when he accidentally (ACCIDENTALLY mark you) hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate, the cow -- and I use the word in all senses -- who is obviously a sick psycho-bitch and the canonical villain of the piece -- throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself. (I doubt it was her first.) When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self-inflicted wounds, her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt, kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan. Obviously as among humans, total psychos date other total psychos.<br /><br />The film reeks of half-thought out anti-human message, ""the poor poor whale!! the evil men must suffer and die!"" and yet, it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all. It's true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel, but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and, as the film progresses, he grows more and more compassionate to the whale's pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale, just to make it feel a little better.<br /><br />The films final journey, in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north, reminds me of Melville's eerie man-whale connection, and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion, where these two husbands might connect, understand even respect each other in their own grief, for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident. It's clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss. However, it never goes there. The whale-character has no compassion or respect for anyone.<br /><br />The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws-like where the sea-monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no-doubt through an oversight, fails to chomp up the whale-hugger (tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier.) I love animals, and I detest whaling, and what is more I love orca whales, but if this film's goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed. Nolan shows compassion and growth, and feels for others, and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming.<br /><br />The only message one can walk away with is ""If you see an orca whale, ever, anywhere, run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way, he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you."",negative";Movie
Why, o' WHY! ...did I pick this one up? Well... i needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the cover looked cool.<br /><br />Of course I should've known better. This is a really, really bad movie.

"Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; the first difficulty faced by the submarine ""Seaview"" is what appear to be chunks of--rock? falling down through the water and crashing into its hull. But it's not rock, they're under the North Pole--it is ICE! Everybody, except possibly hitherto mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS.<br /><br />Then, disaster strikes--that darn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around the Earth catches fire! No one knows how this happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is utterly impossible for radiation to ""catch fire"", and even if it could, there is NO AIR IN SPACE for it to burn.<br /><br />There is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to 2nd grade school textbooks when making a film; however, Irwin Allen manages to do it again and again; perhaps we are meant to focus on the ""people"" instead, which is pretty easy, as they are CARDBOARD.<br /><br />The cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub-kiddie romp, much like later episodes of his ""Lost in Space"" TV series, the concept of which was swiped outright from writer Ib Melchior and then rushed into production.<br /><br />The sub looks pretty good, though, which is why this one gets a ""2"".,negative";Movie
Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I don't think so. I was so horrified by this movie, I could barely watch it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!,negative;Movie
"A plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro-life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed. The horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific, but, instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death, despite the title itself. Being a fan of Masters of Horror since the beginning, this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon. I view this episode as being thrown together from the get go, never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to ""The End""..,negative";Movie
"Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. That is the first, most important, and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re-imagining Scooby-Doo and company.<br /><br />Shaggy's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows. They've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they're on about yet with the villain angle, but it surely isn't following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.<br /><br />And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me; this might, too.<br /><br />It's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice. That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly. Besides, I am trying not to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. We'll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then I'll have formed a much more solid opinion.,negative";Movie
"I often wonder how movies like this even get made, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them.<br /><br />With Aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ludicrous they were. The script was non existent with inane dialogs such as ""Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hota hai"" and ""Yeh Versace hai Madam"" (yeah right).<br /><br />Every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. Acting was awful. Constumes (lycra for Udita and awful suits for a stocky Emran), locales (the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian mansion), screenplay etc etc, just one word- rubbish.<br /><br />For those people who love Hashmi and his movies, watch it. As for me, I'll never get those two and a half hours back. The only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent.,negative";Movie

Even this early in his career, Capra was quite accomplished with his camera-work and his timing. This is a thin story -- and quite predictable at times -- but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that -- the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune.<br /><br />Nonetheless, because of his good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clichés. Then the movie does become more original, as the married couple have to find a way to make a living. The ending is very predictable but satisfying. I also want to compliment the title-writing: very witty and fun.,positive;Movie
Uwe Boll slips back in his film-making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island. An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. Its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. Additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, I'm guessing that Boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. It really stinks. Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed. The last film he made that was this bad was Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This isn't that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film. I'd take a pass unless it's late at night and you're catching it on cable.,negative;Movie
This video is so hilariously funny, it makes everything else<br /><br />by Eddie Murphy seem very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which just goes to show you how good this really is). To be honest, I don't think that I've ever<br /><br />laughed at something as much as this, including Naked Gun and the rarely seen Bargearse. This show is amazing, although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with F that is four letters long (plus its extended version beginning with M) but it didn't bother me.

This film is dreadful. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise. While there are some (far and few) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is laboured, hackneyed and ultimately, mindlessly boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client/love interest) all have quite considerable screen presence. Despite being played for what might be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this film is consistently middle-class middle-of-the-road muck. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life on this.

"It's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place. The characters are so weak, and the acting so uninspired, that it's impossible to care about any of them-- especially Brooke Shields.

I never watched the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition. I was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end.<br /><br />Yes, the plot's been done (The Most Dangerous Game, etc.) but I was hoping for, and almost received, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. I think the high-tech was overdone (GPS's) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of Night Rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone.<br /><br />The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD (Suspension of Disbelief) that was required of the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and NO COPS show up to investigate? Could a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and NO COPS show up? Pleeease. Way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much.<br /><br />The final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves IMHO - they were winners from a reality show.<br /><br />Knock me out.,positive;Movie
I am a big fan of old horror movies, and since I am middle aged, old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920's to 1960's period. I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies, with one exception being Creepshow 1, which I thought was great. I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook, and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had some decent development, the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad, the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear, and the funny bits were really funny! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it's telling you something.....4 of 10. Also, Romero's expertise is hard to find here, they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard (I don't know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on. It's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing (yuck yuck) to see it.,negative;Movie
I just wanted to say that. I love Gheorghe Muresan, so I automatically loved this movie. Everything else about it was so-so... Billy Crystal is a good actor, even if he is annoying. But the thing that made this movie was- at least, for a basketball fan- seeing Gheorghe Muresan act.,positive;Movie

"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like ""The Flesh and the Fiends"" and ""From Beyond the Grave"", pairing up in a mid-70's satanic themed exploitation flick. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can. To my deepest regret ""Land of the Minotaur"" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote little area in Greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. ""Land of the Minotaur"" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.,negative";Movie
The three shorts included on this compilation issued in 1959 are timeless Chaplin classics, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. Chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done. The problem with this compilation is a minor one, yet annoying. The shorts have been stretch-printed to fit the 24 frame p.s. speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at 20 frames p.s. This results is jerky motion that doesn't look very attractive, and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time, it's just not excusable that the current DVD version is unrestored, the films look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still stretch printed. There are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and it would not be a problem to restore the image, but alas this has not been done.<br /><br />A minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article, but I say again a minor quibble, it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating. The shorts are still worth '10'.,positive;Movie
1979's Tourist Trap is a clever, unique B thriller that stands out as one of the best of it's kind.<br /><br />Travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner's mannequins are a little too life-like for comfort.<br /><br />While the film has hints of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Tourist Trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of The Twilight Zone. Director David Schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, that reaches nightmarish proportions. Also, Schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings.<br /><br />Venteran actor Chuck Connors is the best of the film's decent cast. Pino Donaggio's music score is excellent, having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie. A number of the film's sequences are quite memorable.<br /><br />For horror and thriller fans alike, Tourist Trap is an unforgettable must-see film.<br /><br />*** 1/2 out of ****,positive;Movie
Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me, the atmosphere of the movie was first class, the acting memorable and the storyline a classic. Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2...... I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie, again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III ........ WRONG!, I wish I'd stopped at II. The storyline was not good, it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story, the characters were weak especially the daughter. Pacino's protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2. Then scenes such as, Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir, the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset, the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting (where the 'goodies' get away and everyone else is shot),daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board, the pathetic shooting on the steps ..... Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes (a man of his intelligence and guile isn't ready for an emergency?)... NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again. But I'll watch 1 & 2 many times down the years.,negative;Movie
This little two-person movie is actually much bigger than it looks. It has so many layers. I've watched it over and over, and always pick up on something new. I am amazed at the depth of the acting, and I feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that Alan Rickman is a major star,positive;Movie
"UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young, the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based. The key word here is ""based"". How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom.<br /><br />Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York, where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It. This involves him selling out, and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not overdone: the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney's misadventures. The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart, moderately obnoxious skilled writer. This contradiction is never that much of an issue, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects likability too well.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney's editor a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidney's affections And, with regard to Megan Fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), I can say only this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort. Of course, given that I'm a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you might not find my offer too enticing, but it's there on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far, one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become: however, she does it sweetly, with some skill, and extremely sexily. This girl will go far.<br /><br />There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US.<br /><br />There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and I smiled most of the way through. As ever, the F-word makes appearances when it really doesn't need to, although at least a couple of these are very funny.,positive";Movie
Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with of all things On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. <br /><br />Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. AGGH!) <br /><br />In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke.<br /><br />With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /><br />I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame, Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.<br /><br />That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.<br /><br />Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie.,negative;Movie
"I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. ""You Are Alone"" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again, as if I am seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!! It was compelling and riveting.<br /><br />I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed. I admired Brittany's strength (what a strong woman).<br /><br />The tag line is ""When your darkest moments come to life"". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says oh I would never do that, when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject. The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part.<br /><br />Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!,positive";Movie
I love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie. Not just because I'm a huge Linnea Quigley-Jill Terashita fan, but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times.<br /><br />The special effects are awesome, especially Linnea's scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed.<br /><br />Plenty of nudity provided by Linnea and Jill, plenty of humor, cool soundtrack, high body count, etc...By the way, if you have never seen this one, try and buy/watch the Unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing.,positive;Movie

"Lorna Green(Janine Reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. It's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. After the murders within her fantasies are committed, Lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.<br /><br />If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco, I'd say it's elegant & difficult. By now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. And, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even Franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched ""Succubus"", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! Some might say that ""Succubus"" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, ""Venus in Furs"", considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. In a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, ""Succubus"" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. And, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. ""Succubus"" is also populated by beatnik types and ""poet-speak"", Corman's film, ""A Bucket of Blood"" poked fun at. My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. Great locations and jazz score..I liked this film myself, although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.,positive";Movie
"This outing of Knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever, Frank Welker. Welker makes the film. Knotts and Welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty. Knotts works for a small ""no where"" town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials. When things go wrong the city fathers, allow Knotts to take the fall. Frank Welker's character befriends Knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and Knott's good name. This film shows the usual Knott's scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film. This may have been Knotts' last good outing. When you have an extra 90 minutes, get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon, Don Knotts.,positive";Movie
Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it. Of course there were all the scenes I disliked but the majority was well acted and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The film also stars Toni Collette(Who has okay but has been much better) Ewan Mecgreger(Who has also been better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming(Who I have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here) and Jeremy Northam(Who's performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle, even if that was not what it needed) There have been much better adaptations of Jane Austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.,positive;Movie
"Why do I hate this? Let me list the ways:<br /><br />I have nothing against Mary Pickford but a 32 year old woman playing a 12 year old is just stupid.<br /><br />There's a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it's considered funny---and it goes on for 15 minutes <br /><br />Strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt<br /><br />The title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs<br /><br />For a ""family"" film the fights were WAY too violent (loved it when Pickford was punching it out with a little boy!) and the humor was just stupid <br /><br />Seriously, 40 minutes in I gave up and turned it off. The slurs, racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me. Also there was no plot that I could see. The only thing worth seeing in this film was William Haines who was a top leading man in the silent era.<br /><br />Just painful. Avoid.,negative";Movie
"Thank God this wasn't based on a true story, because what a story it is. Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.<br /><br />The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: ""Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery"", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands. Proceed with caution.,positive";Movie

"The movie was gripping from start to finish and its b/w photography of the American heartland is stunning. We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment. <br /><br />The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there. Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities.<br /><br />There are many fine supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney.<br /><br />I have often wanted to see this movie all the way through, having only caught it in short snatches; I did finally get to it after buying the DVD. The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Don't miss this brilliant movie. To me, this is what great film-making is all about.,positive";Movie
"This is a great show with total freshness and innovation. That usual chair (couch for a woman) host, that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes, the same old jokes, the same pattern copied from the days of Nebuchadnezzer ....probably the pattern of Johnny Carson, copied by one and all, Latterman, Leno, Conan... Daly, this show does not seem to have any of these.<br /><br />I fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and I am going to stick to it. Though it's too early to say that, this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project, and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. I hope that this show will last long!<br /><br />Returning back after months, I still love this show, and I love his self-deprecating humor (For example, his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus, the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys) which, however, does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien, for example (I know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by O'Brien's antics; but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness). <br /><br />I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen's spoof of Trading Spouses (and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode) are hilarious. Idiot paparazzi are fun, especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures, and (if I am not mistaken) they start taking his pictures shouting ""Gary Coleman"".<br /><br />Added on 16th April, 2007: Coming back once again, I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. Either way, it was funny as hell.<br /><br />I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages, but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so, I would better write down my suggestion here for him: I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon, the star of late night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show, sing a song (and play guitar), do a skit in the line of SNL, and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles (I know, Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this, but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA).<br /><br />God willing!<br /><br />Returning back on 14th July, 2007: Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talkshow must be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me, but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.,positive";Movie
"It's all about getting what you want when you want it. And the message of Bluebeard's Eighth WIfe is to be careful what you wish for, until what you wish for wishes for you.<br /><br />Most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn't relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue. Misogynistic pirates aside, Cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it, learning only too late that it wasn't what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty Claudette Colbert. Through a twisted (in soul and in practice) business deal, he ends up marring/buying her with the intent of bedding her, but she will have none of it (literally) and frustrates him at every turn, and corner, and room, and tourist attraction.<br /><br />The film has definite French sensibilities which means it has strong double-entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you're not accustomed to (and may not enjoy seeing) in either Cooper or Colbert. The whole reason I watched the film was because they are ""likable"" actors, and the whole point of this movie is that they're unlikable people, or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves, they think, from the world. <br /><br />If you can accept it on its own terms you'll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film...and satisfaction, as we said, is what it's all about. Such a movie with such a cast only comes around, after all, once in a...ummm...blue moon.,positive";Movie
Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I'm appalled. For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to. Let me tell u something. I started watching many T.V shows like Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood and even Invasion. But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. Then we have The Sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. There is no department that this show doesn't excel in. Acting- Nothing short of superb. James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony. The raw emotion he displays is superb. Then we have everyone else, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese (whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2) and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie 'Walnuts' Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All of these actors perform to the best quality, and all giving an excellent performance in each episode. Then we have the story, never have i been so sucked into a T.V show before. The story is nothing short of excellent. Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic. I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of. Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television, and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show. Not just say its too violent, or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral, i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day, i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God. I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you'll be hooked from the very first episode, i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show, hooked on it. Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V. After you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.,positive;Movie
"I'd give this a negative rating if I could. I went into this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind. The whole thing is stupid! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson. Oh how original; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously,the worst thing I've ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't funny,I wasn't even bored! I wasn't anything.

"Most people are totally unaware that this movie exists. Fox, which paid Judge to make it, has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it. I guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer. Well, I am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe. Basically, Judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin. Then these stupid are getting more stupid, by basically spending all of their time watching TV and having sex, which produces more stupid people. By 2500, a person of average intelligence today, will appear to be a genius, that talks ""all faggy."" Seriously, is this really that hard to believe. Oh sure, this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid, but still plausible. Luke Wilson is great as the time traveling army guy, hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time. Where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one-liners, like ""can we family style her"" and ""hey man, I'm 'bating here!"" This is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an American society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure, comfort and stupidity, and I guarantee you that I will be buying this on DVD the first day it comes out and watching it over and over.,positive";Movie
This is a great, ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s' obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was. I can remember being freaked out by metal teens when I was a kid. It doesn't help that I found a desecrated grave in my hometown's graveyard when I was ten. Turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan. So maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile, but I love it now, as a 24 year old.<br /><br />I bought this DVD used for 6 bucks and I expected it to suck due to the lame cover, but to my surprise, it ruled. It is all about the extreme demonic power of metal. And you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd. This movie is awesome, if you love 80s metal and bad movies, this one's for you. 9/10!,positive;Movie
While not quite as good as A Murder is Announced, which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book, this is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I don't take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace, and both of the above problems, and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations, worst being Sittaford Mystery, which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement, it not only respects the book, despite a few liberties, but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had. Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating, more to do with how he was written than how he was acted, and one or two moments of sluggish pacing, this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with nice photography and period detail, and the music as always is excellent. The performances are wonderful this time around, and make the most of an in general well-done script, with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple, and solid turns from Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde. Overall, well worth watching, better than the recent version in pretty much all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox,positive;Movie

I had heard (and read) so many good things about Weeds that I was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable Series (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men) but that slowly eroded away with each episode I watched from Season One. (didn't make it past the first six episodes) <br /><br />The writing was unoriginal, contrived and the portrayal of Blacks embarrassing. The dialog felt forced, like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip . It was a rare moment when I actually emitted an audible laugh.<br /><br />The characters never developed enough for me to care about them, they were selfish and unappealing. I absolutely HATED the addition of the Brother-in-law (who should have been hauled away on To Catch A Predator) and the removal of the Hodes' daughter Quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and cliché, I had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer's loyalty.<br /><br />Episode after episode I liked the characters less and couldn't get past many of the technical flaws in the story line.<br /><br />Add to that I heard that Season Two wasn't as good, so I lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out.<br /><br />If you're a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like, unless of course you're stoned and then all bets are off.,negative;Movie
This movie is among my favorite foreign films, some of the others are Amilee and My Life As a Dog. The similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films, is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson. <br /><br />In Japan, a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life, sees a beautiful Japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio. In the instant that it takes his train to pass, he is enthralled by her. But is it only by her beauty, by her faraway glance, or a connection that they will both discover that they share? <br /><br />Shall We Dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance. Breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of Japanese society, they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away. It is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and, in itself, transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be.,positive;Movie
"As if the film were not of value in itself, this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the film in NYC; that fall in graduate school, I read the book for the first time. Some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film.

This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution. It is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love. <br /><br />The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film. DREAMING OF JULIA makes much more sense. It has more in common with European cinema than with RAMBO and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people's daily lives and pursuits. That fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in Cuban history.<br /><br />The excessive use of the voice-over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from Hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could.<br /><br />The comparisons to CINEMA PARADISO and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /><br />The revolution, like the film JULIE, never seems to have an ending.,positive;Movie
"I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a major disappointment. Its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey '60s. It's politics too upfront and ridiculous. And let's face it, I was still under a love-spell known as BLOWUP : and I still haven't completely shaken it. Now the ""love"" is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and, oh well . . . Good Luck to me!<br /><br />But time marches on and time has been kind to ZP and time has been a teacher to me. I revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is it's own ""experience""and is only really linked to BLOWUP through its creator, the late,great Mr. Antonioni.<br /><br />Twelve years ago, I had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print, projected at its correct size (immense), restored by an Italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape. To this day I remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. It was like a thousand volt visual shock Antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness. And indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of ""place"".<br /><br />What is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own.<br /><br />I remember the second time around seeing it --- the early 80s --- I had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards Daria and Mark in particular. Whereas, before these two seemed like a smart-alecky shadow version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet)they now were engaging me --- particularly The Girl in her insistent slo-motion-ality. She-took-her-time . . . To Live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around her.<br /><br />Upon exciting the theater the daylight of Reality quickly began to erase my new found ""enjoyment"". The encroaching shoulder-padded, big haired 80s whispered ""But that's a hippie fantasy --- let it go""<br /><br />The force of Antonioni's vision had, I had realised, already worked itself inside of me the FIRST time around so I answered ""80s"" with an ""Uh-Huh"" and guarded my ""love"" secretly, possessively and jealously.<br /><br />But, this, then is what good art does it lives inside of you, and, if you wish it has its way and ""loves"" you back: secretly, jealously, and possessively. And you get ""changed"".<br /><br />Was thrilled to see that Turner Classic Movies had decided to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment. But, hey, sometimes even a glimpse of the Beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all.<br /><br />Today reality hit, ZP has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of ALICE'S RESTAURANT.<br /><br />So, it is still too ""difficult"", too ""disturbing"", too ""what""?<br /><br />Maybe it's that, as with all good art, it Lives while everything dies around it. <br /><br />Peace.,positive";Movie
Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story, but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice, gruesome make-up effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl, carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital. She escapes again, however, and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It's all pretty to look at and listen too (really great soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast. Luckily enough, leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too weird and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts. Yeah, right...,negative;Movie
"This is an interesting, hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps, as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE, BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70's were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career, and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Hedge', quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really, at the height of his popularity, this movie could have done so much more with JMV's talent and his looks. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil, as explored in ""Buster and Billie"", is much more dramatic! Anyway, Glynnis O'Connor is delightful as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada.,positive";Movie
Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd love to buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA,positive;Movie
Jäniksen vuosi is one of Jarva's most political movies. It takes stance strongly against modern day society's authority status in the life of the common man, and how it has estranged men from the nature completely. It challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society.<br /><br />Vatanen (Antti Litja) - smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations - tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern Finland - only to realize that the concept of a 'free country' isn't all that unambiguous, in other words, the society has the common man by the balls.<br /><br />Still the thing that makes Jäniksen vuosi so exceptional - besides the visual and humouristic brilliance - is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in Finland in the 70's, as well as the whole identity of Finland as a nation. Vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness. Since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us Finns, the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes Jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving.,positive;Movie
"I love Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see.<br /><br />And I walked out of this one.<br /><br />Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (""Oh no, Jamie's knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!""), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.<br /><br />The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point, it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too many ""tough guy"" lines... and I don't mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx. I gave it a 2.,negative";Movie
After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99$ bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.,positive;Movie
Send them to the freezer. This is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film. The complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive.,positive;Movie
"Wow! I picked this off the rental shelf because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting.' This is a phenomenal movie; it has action, romance, suspense, intrigue and wit.

This film has everything to keep ME happy!,positive";Movie
I don't know why some people criticise that show so much.<br /><br />It is a great, funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time, but still...<br /><br />The family dynamics are funny, and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are only just above average, but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing.<br /><br />This show was well worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it.<br /><br />rating: 8/10,positive;Movie
Mexican Werewolf in Texas is set in the small border town of Furlough where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) & she has a Mexican boyfriend named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town, killing livestock & several residents including some of their friends. Local Mexican legends speak of the Chupacabra, an evil creature from myth & legend. Erm, I'm struggling now because not that much else actually happens...<br /><br />Written & directed by Scott Maginnis I won't beat about the bush here & simply say that Mexican Werewolf in Texas is awful, period. The script only ever mentions the word Werewolf once & the rest of the time it's referred to a Chupacabra, in fact I suspect this wasn't really conceived as a Werewolf flick at all. The 'Werewolf' creature looks mostly hairless & more like some vicious dog, there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon & it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no transformation scene & at the end when it is killed it doesn't change back into anyone either. To be honest apart from the title there's nothing here to indicate a Werewolf film at all & even then the title is just a rip-off of the highly popular An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the type of home made crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday the 13th (1980) which were all made on shoe string budgets, maybe The Blair Witch Project (1999) but that's it in recent years & crap like Mexican Werewolf in Texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic. The character's are awful & things just happen around them, the dialogue is rubbish, the pacing is terrible, the story sucks & virtually sent me to sleep & as a whole this film is just crap, I'm sorry but I don't know how else to describe it.<br /><br />Director Maginnis does nothing to make this watchable, there's the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache & quick 'blink & you'll miss something' editing which just annoys & irritates in equal measure. It's not scary, there's no nudity, there's no tension or atmosphere & the special effects are awful. The monster really does look poor & it's no wonder Maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it. There's virtually no colour to the picture either, it's either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well. The gore consists of some fake guts (blink & you'll miss them!), a few bloody wounds & a severed arm, big deal.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $300,000 I admit the budget was low but I simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film, there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far. The whole thing has the look of a home movie, it has no style & is throughly bland & dull to look at. The acting sucks too although you probably already knew that.<br /><br />Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably con a few people into renting/buying/watching it because they might mistakenly think it's a sequel to John Landis' classic which it most certainly isn't & it isn't even a proper Werewolf flick either. Don't be fooled this is awful & I'm fed up of having to waste time/money on home made amateur crap like this.,negative;Movie
I found this to be a surprisingly light-handed touch at a 1950's culture-clash movie. John Wayne would hardly be one's first choice as a cultural attache, being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull-run in Harrods. But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona, and he accomplished his task with style. The Duke was a guy who really could act well. His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.<br /><br />Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he failed to dominate this movie. Many of his good intentions came a cropper. He had authority over nobody, and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.<br /><br />The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell-for-leather battles. I cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well. There was a great deal of minutely-choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props. The set pieces were complex and detailed. A lot of money and thought had been applied to it.<br /><br />The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag-waving effort. Script was good without being too wordy. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue, but the lengthy periods of translation didn't interfere with the narrative. It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set. Whether or not they were Japanese, I couldn't say. But anyway they looked the part. At least the leads were not played by cross-dressing Caucasians, unlike other efforts such as 'Blood Alley' (yes, I know they were Chinese) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or even 'The King And I'.<br /><br />Frankly, I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies. The script was better for a start. I never liked the songs in 'The King And I', and wasn't impressed by the heavy-laden anti-communist subtext of 'Blood Alley'. I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke's more popular outings.<br /><br />Recommended.,positive;Movie
I was so glad I came across this short film. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across, so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple, the director, writer, and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy.<br /><br />It's a well made short film, well edited and the actors all do a great job. And the last shot of the film is perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.,positive;Movie
I thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one, but when i started with it i found it really awful. They said movie is being made in Afghanistan but i think 95% of the movie is shot in India. you can see Indian made cars. you can see lars drinking bisleri(an Indian water brand), Hindi written on the road, you can also see temples in Afghanistan *hahah* its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in Afghanistan. I think one should not waste his/her time watching this movie.. pure time waste.. i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time,negative;Movie
"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. And i can count the films I have switched off before the end on one hand.<br /><br />The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless.<br /><br />The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you aren't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.<br /><br />The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.<br /><br />Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /><br />In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film.,negative";Movie
"In this movie, Chávez supporters (either venezuelan and not-venezuelan) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /><br />They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement firing a lot of PDVSA best workers just for political issues.<br /><br />They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez during only 3 days in ""CADENA NACIONAL"" (a kind of confiscation o private TV signals). Each one with about 20 minutes of duration.<br /><br />They did not tell us anything about The quiting announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, Inspector General of the army forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, in despite of his announcement, he is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After Chávez return he occuped the Charge of Ministro del Defensa (equals to Defense Secretary in US).<br /><br />They did not say anything about Chávez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections.<br /><br />They did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by Chávez Supporters (either civilians and Military official forces).<br /><br />They present some facts in a wrong order, in order to lie.<br /><br />They did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and Chávez actions in order to avoid the elections.<br /><br />That's why i tell you....

"One could wish that an idea as good as the ""invisible man"" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.<br /><br />There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, ""Hollow Man"" is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.<br /><br />However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go ""Oh darn!"" and ""Oh my God"". ""Hollow Man"" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.,negative";Movie
"OK, so it owes Pulp Fiction, but in my opinion has it's own voice and identity mainly because of the music-video direction style, sketch-like narrative and great performances. Thomas Jane delivers great (the drug-dealer show-down is extraordinary), Aaron Eckhart likewise. James LeGros has a short and effervescent appearance-great humor-""they got the Wong house"". The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable, as is Mickey Rourke's cameo appearance-""take a peak"".<br /><br />Great Hollywood popcorn B-production with strong performances of A-level aspirants and renegades(Rourke).<br /><br />Well, take a peak, it's worth.,positive";Movie
As far as I know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal, I'd agree with him. This is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body part helping him. Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. He has a special left foot though, he can write with it, paint with it and hold things with it. He learns to speak later in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. Also starring Home Alone 2's Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winning Ray McAnally as Mr. Brown. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Make Up Artist and Best Adapted Screenplay. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Films.

"All I ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better. All the while watching I was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future, and there wasn't. I'll admit to not finishing the film, I had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and I quote, ""More tail than any man in the past time."" I know not finishing it is a bad review on myself, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested, and they failed. This film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead it exemplifies what America ran by lesbian natzis would be like,and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you Mr. Director! Someone please give me a redeeming quality... wait I have it! There's no sequel!,negative";Movie
I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.,negative;Movie

This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months. While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be, my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it. Then I went and saw it, I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not trying to go into them with too many expectations, but this movie was not that funny. Now it wasnt the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO. If you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it, but for true comedy fans Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead!!!,negative;Movie
As far as I know this was my first experience with Icelandic movies. It's such a relief to see something else than your regular Hollywood motion picture. Too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope that people watch this by accident, by recommendation or other...<br /><br />Because it's really worth while. I left the cinema feeling really sad. I couldn't get the tragic destiny's of the characters out of my head. And it impressed me even more when I thought of the complexity of the film.

"Very typical Almodóvar of the time and, in its own way, no less funny than many of his later works. And why is that? There is nothing to be provoked or shocked about, and I guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional. No, the great humor stems from an underlying, almost surreal, absurdity that is woven into the scenery: The characters' nearly complete lack of taboo. It's the same kind of 'comic suspense' you find in his later works, though you'll find it in a more rough version here. He's building up for masterpieces to come, but is not yet there.<br /><br />The sole reviewer who commented on this movie before I did, claimed that it had to be a ""very select"" group of people who'd find this movie hilarious. I do.,positive";Movie
"Once again, Doctor Who delivers the goods by the bucket load. It has humour (""You're just making it up as you go along!"" ""Yup, but I do it brilliantly""), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cybermen), tragedy and scare tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of ""get on with it"". So, chalk up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that have made you laugh, then made you cry, and made you go ""eek"".<br /><br />In terms of character development, this is clearly the clincher for Noel Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the Doctor's companions, you know that he will do the right thing, and may even suspect the manner that he does it. However, it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path.<br /><br />While ""The rise of the Cybermen"" had more of the sinister build up to terror, ""The Age of Steel"" is an all out blast.

A Brother's Promise is a wonderful family film. This is a biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood. The love and support of the family members is evident throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us. The commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, shows what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating. The faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives. This is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age.,positive;Movie
"Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" crapfest, I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in ""The House of Seven Corpses,"" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like ""Satan's School for Girls"" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. ""The House of Seven Corpses"" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second...,negative";Movie
Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces,like Network,Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.Now,Lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet.This movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.Also,I think the ending of the movie is perfect.The performances are brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he's,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view.His performance in here is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great Albert Finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars.The film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.We need more movies like this.,positive;Movie
I took my 14 year old to see this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely awful! This movie should be rated R at the least. I am not that strict with movies but, this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it would contain some comedy and I knew the comedy would probably be crude but, this was WAY beyond crude. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me) and I could not believe how crudely sexual it was. I could not believe that it would be OK for a 13 year old to read and see this content. I don't understand how the rating system works.??,negative;Movie
I loved this film. I thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget.

"It's not easy to find Judas Kiss on VHS (it's not available on DVD), but I wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my Alan Rickman movie collection.<br /><br />I can't understand how the talented Mr. Rickman gets into these mediocre films? Judas Kiss boasts several wonderful actors, an interesting plot and intriguing twists, but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama. Many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character's actions: Why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses? Why did he mistrust the detective he replaced? There were times when I honestly couldn't tell if the director meant Judas Kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof. Why else would he toss in a topless/alien/lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes (that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby!)? Did he purposely instruct his two distinguished English actors (Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson) to use such awful New Orlean's accents? As an Alan Freak, I confess that I still thought Mr. Rickman was sexy: in a rumpled, weary, ""take-him-home-and-tuck-him-in"" sort of way.<br /><br />Judas Kiss isn't a great movie, but it does have some intriguing moments, but I don't recommend it unless you're trying to immerse yourself in Alan Rickman.,negative";Movie
"First of all, I should point out that I really enjoyed watching this documentary. Not only it had great music in it, but the shots and the editing were also wonderful. However, all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist ""East meets West"" cliché that bothers many Turks like myself. Okay, this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary Turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing, something that would show ignorant Europeans and Americans that this country is not just about murdering Armenians and Kurds. However, the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as ""east"" from the eyes of the ""west"". I mean, like one jazz musician says in the film, maybe there is no east and west, maybe it is just a myth, a lie created by the ruling leaders of ""western"" countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and ""keep the cash flowing""? <br /><br />Why don't you think about that?,positive";Movie
STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest, so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn't gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film.,negative;Movie
First off, I have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen. Its not even the low budget SCI-Fi channel movie, its just awful. Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a Transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting, but the plot is so awful along with the acting, it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No, The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes, but with magic, and a very small actual war between dragons(rather big snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thing(along with all 5 of the audience), and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest. I've seen a lot of B movies like Reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour, watch this.<br /><br />Story: 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting:3/10<br /><br />I don't drink...but it would have helped before watching this movie,negative;Movie

"Steven Seagal's films of late have not exactly been good, but this is by far the worst since The Patriot. The plot makes no sense what so ever; it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are, who works for who or who is double crossing who. The film is completely disjointed, each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward. Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow. Most of the blame must lie at the director's feet for not even understanding the basics of film making, but Seagal does not get off lightly, as one of the producers of this film, he must also share the blame. Oh, and I haven't even mentioned how awful the acting is, even by Seagal standards. Even as straight to video fodder, this is not worth a view even for Seagal fans. Give it a wide berth!,negative";Movie
"and I for one think that is a good thing. I've just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this.<br /><br />As for the rest of the production, I think it was slightly less than the original movie. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails-on-the-blackboard voice belting out ""HEY! It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah!"" and although I missed it, I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy.<br /><br />I also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage, it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre, not just at the movies.<br /><br />I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song ""Let me entertain you"", which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it.,positive";Movie

"A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from the director at a festival, I think. I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great. So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie.<br /><br />The standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a likable way. Adam Jones (who also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite; he seemed the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really kind of lovable, and very funny. Some of the other acting was good, some was so-so, but none of it was bad. I also really liked the vigilante duo. Ridiculous and funny.<br /><br />I'm giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared, and decided to make their movie their way. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.,positive";Movie
"Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction... all good films. Great films. But nothing, and I mean nothing lives up to the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus.<br /><br />The film is so great and has so many messages, I cried while watching it. Seriously, this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sorrow, and then we wonder... what is so bad about this ice cream? Is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil? Think movie makes you think.<br /><br />This movie has the best rendition of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams, and we wonder; is the Santa we believe in really that good? Also, this Santa actually mentions Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas.<br /><br />You owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece.

"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd, folks: either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight. ""Incidents"" are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.<br /><br />We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk). Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.<br /><br />Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.<br /><br />[SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else, see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. <br /><br />[DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.] <br /><br />,positive";Movie
"This is a stereotype plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight.<br /><br />The fights are not of high standards. They are way too ""simple"" in a way that 1+1 is simple to every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking. The coach yells do this and do that with no success. And after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the fight, although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point. Think about the Rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes. The fights are also shot poorly.<br /><br />There final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance. Cheesy music and awkward moments are not what I call entertainment.<br /><br />These guys really could have made some quality entertainment, but the director wasn't up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don't know, but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.,negative";Movie
This production was quite a surprise for me. I absolutely love obscure early 30s movies, but I wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by any chance, you're not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the finale. Of course, you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think THE CAT'S PAW is not available on video/DVD yet. Watch your PBS listings!,positive;Movie
"It isn't TOO bad, but ultimately it lacks the quality that the Australian series has.<br /><br />The jokes are few and far between, the actors are attractive (they shouldn't be), the film makers think far too much about the cinematography (it's supposed to look like a home video) and it's just like a serious version of Kath and Kim... it's stupid.<br /><br />It's too normal to be Kath and Kim. Kath and Kim are supposed to be two curvy, middle-aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes. There are no ""Look at me Kimmy!"" jokes. The fat friend of Kim is not fat at all and she's not even slightly stupid. She's a stereotypical black/Latino chick.<br /><br />It's just not as stupid or funny as the Australian series. It doesn't compare. Nothing is the same. I admit, this show is pretty funny at times, but it is NOT anything like the Aussie series. I was looking forward to an American take on a bogan family. They failed. It's supposed to be REALLY stupid and hilarious, but the actors don't act stupid! To me, this is just a typical American TV show. It's a let down if you want it to be anything like the Aussie show.<br /><br />2 Stars because it is an OKAY show, just nothing like what it should be.,negative";Movie
"From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés (deformed hicks, a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show, the rebellious daughter, the one 'freak' who's good at heart, etcetera...), but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time.

"This film is where the Batman franchise ought to have stopped. Though I will concede that the ideas behind ""Batman Forever"" were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director, as it turned out this was not to be the case.<br /><br />Apparently Warner Brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second Batman film from Tim Burton turned out. Apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from Burton, and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the Sixties TV series, I fail to understand how ""Batman Returns"" can be considered at all disappointing.<br /><br />True, it is not quite the equal of the first film - though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in ""Batman,"" a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of Keaton and Jack Nicholson as the Joker in the first film. Yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film, true to the way the Batman was always meant to be, and highly satisfying.<br /><br />Michael Keaton returns as the Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne, tangling with nouveau riche tycoon Max Schreck (Christopher Walken, named in honour of the 1920s German silent actor), his partner-in-crime Oswald Cobblepot, the Penguin (Danny DeVito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of Laurence Olivier's ""Richard III""), and Selina Kyle, the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom Wayne romances both as himself and as the Batman. The four principals turn in excellent performances, especially Walken and DeVito, while together Keaton and Pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities.<br /><br />There are some intriguing concepts in this film. About the only weakness I can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places, which I think is due mostly to the way this film is a four-cornered fight. There simply isn't enough time to properly explore what's going on.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a damn good film. I highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first, and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under Burton and Keaton.,positive";Movie
"The Quick and the Undead is, finally, the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void. It is, essentially, one gigantic plot hole.<br /><br />Aside from that, the acting was quite bad, character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth hanging our hat on. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist) got snuffed halfway through the proceedings.<br /><br />What the Quick and the Undead DOES serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color-timing. It looked excellent, when you take into account budget considerations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns (most notably The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie... ""you know, they have movies where characters do THIS! Does it fit here? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies so I should do it here!"" <br /><br />Maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists (first-year film-schoolers). Otherwise, a must-miss.,negative";Movie
I was stunned by this film. Afterwards, I didn't even want to see any films for a long time- any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison.<br /><br />For many, it may be the worst of Antonioni- very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions- and the worst of Wenders- verbose, confused transcendentalism. It is composed of short distinct episodes linked by Wenders' typical meandering hero's stream of consciousness, so it doesn't produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema.<br /><br />But for fans, the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things.<br /><br />,positive;Movie
Am I the only person who thinks that the entire Forensics and Scenes Of Crime community in the USA must detest this almighty slap in their faces. A rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time he returns (still no senior cops, SOCOs or other assistance for the lovely Jolie - this is New York isn't it??) it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence, only after she'd stood in front of an Amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene.<br /><br />I want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images!! The horror continues:- not in the film itself (pretty ordinary I'm afraid) but in the Lincoln Rhyme character as played by Mr Washington. This man is a highly dedicated Forensic Crime Scene Examiner with years of experience who, instead of the highly trained but invisible local Crime Scene Examiners, entrusts the work to an untrained cop, a rookie cop, who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making DNA profiling well nigh impossible. Now that was a bright idea eh? I know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable.<br /><br />I have given this film 4/10 for the superb acting of Denzel Washington and for Miss Jolie's lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended!,negative;Movie

This is the second Hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second Hitchcock film I've seen in full, the first was Rope, which I really enjoyed. With Saboteur Hitchcock was more room to roam free, whereas Rope took place all in one room. I didn't enjoy this one as much as Rope but that's not saying this is a bad film, it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more.<br /><br />It seems like a film Hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones. As a thriller, I feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the States. The climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension. The sound design is almost non existent. You can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them, but the important things are missing, the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve, the need of music to amp of the tension, all missing. Intentional no doubt, yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene. Then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside.<br /><br />The film doesn't feel like it should either, they are almost globe trotting from place to place, yet it feels more confined. The script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving.<br /><br />The performances are there, but nothing amazing. Everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page. The relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work. The one stand out is Otto Kruger, who has that rich, ego, evil persona down pat.<br /><br />In the end, I wanted more from this one. I understand it's one of Hitchcock's least exciting films, but I did have a good time watching it. I can recommend it, just not enthusiastically.,positive;Movie
It is always difficult to bring a 450 pages book down to a three hours film. I read the book before, and I found the BBC production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible. The qualities of the book haven't been lost: the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is brought up, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists of the story, the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from Sue's point of view then from Maud's one. The main actors do very good, and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other, because they still love each other.<br /><br />For each of her books the author, Sarah Waters, has thoroughly investigated what life was like in British 19th century. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in London and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions, and suspense.,positive;Movie
This is one of my all time favorite cheap, corny, vampire B movies. <br /><br />Calvin Klein underwear model...oh, I mean, Stefan the Good Vampire, returns to Transylvania to ascend the throne of Vampiric Royalty, but Manicure-impaired and eternally drooling half brother Radu has other plans. Having killed their father the Vampire King, Radu now sets his sights on Stefan, Stefan's new mortal girlfriend Michelle and her two pretty friends, and the all-powerful Bloodstone.<br /><br />Okay, the scenery is beautiful, and it should be as it was shot on location in Transyl-fricken-vania for gosh sakes. The actresses are no great shakes and Stefan the Heroic Vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker, but who cares? There's only one reason to watch this movie, and his name is RADU! He's a physical homage to Nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie, all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day. The cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film, as Radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning, slobbering face for the world to see. I found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother. But maybe I'm just a sicko. Questionable taste in men aside, I highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts. It's original, it's fun, and Radu is one of the best vampires I've seen in a long time...much more fun than the stiff, tragic, whining Undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days. Radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes. He's what a vampire should be.,positive;Movie
"Let me first off say that I am a believer of ghosts, and I do indeed know they exist. I have had enough experiences with them to know they are there.<br /><br />What I hate is the people who bring the Bible and Religion into all of this. People forget there is more than one ""Bible"", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God, and not everyone believes in stereo-typical religion. <br /><br />Religion does not make everything fact, one of the things I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant Bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within....you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time, slavery is OK, and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances. None of this, ""Oh that was the Old testament, and now we have the New Testament."" If the Bible is the word of God, and cannot be changed..there should be no changes, or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who so blindly follow it that there, ""Is no other way."" The excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic, or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly, and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their Pastor or teacher. <br /><br />But anyhow, onto the review. I am a decent fan of ""Ghost Hunters"" and when I heard this show was coming soon, I was pretty excited and thought it had some potential. As much as I like watching ""Ghost Hunters"", I do not like some of their members, and I do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted, yet cannot explain anything that is going on. Just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up, does not mean the camera filming the show did not. I am glad they are skeptical, but it's like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not. If Ghosts were that easy to capture, it would be known as a fact, not a belief. It's more of a ""right place at the right time"" kind of thing, as well as if there is something there, what makes you think it's going to ""perform"" for you? This show is kind of silly. It's usually boring, and there is lots of talk, lots of psychics, yet hardly anything happens. The main guy's filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to, or is basically not needed.<br /><br />Also, the reliance on psychics is too abundant, as I believe VERY few of them are actually gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe in, but most are sometimes hard to believe.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this show, but of the few I have seen I have yet to be terribly impressed.,negative";Movie
For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by 'City on the Edge of Forever.' What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it's more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline. I still think it's fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. Though the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of Spock being court-martialed is a clever one. You can poke holes in the plot if you want. For instance, given the Talosians' mind-control abilities and Captain Pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez... best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy ST's only two-parter.,positive;Movie
Coen Brothers-wannabe from writer-director Paul Chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other (better) movies, yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching. Robert Forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who goes on a killing spree in the desert. The film is unusual, but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience, it becomes alienating and off-putting (with a role for Amanda Plummer that is downright humiliating). An admittedly bravura finale, many quirky bits of business--and Forster looking great in the nude--make this a curiosity item, nothing more. Veteran movie-director Irvin Kershner produced, and maybe should directed as well (could Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). *1/2 from ****,negative;Movie
When it was released this film caused a sensation. I watched it and was thrilled. Beautiful, usually young, naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director Hamiltons photography. His photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie. Today I saw it again and was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow paced scenes, all filmed with some Vaseline on the lenses, actually is all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. Actually nothing happens. It is like Hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills. And this gets so boring after a while. I even didn't watch the whole thing the second time, for I fell vast asleep. That is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is a very good sleeping pill. And you will never become addicted to it!<br /><br />Back then 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10,negative;Movie
"Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Kerman & employer Agren travel into the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister.<br /><br />Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardona's ""Guyana - Crime of the Century"". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) topical Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion. With sister in toe, Kerman & Agren attempt to stop the rot, but after several failed coups, they end up fleeing into the ""Green Inferno"", only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites.<br /><br />One in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies/early eighties, where every new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures. This inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others, but with much less success.<br /><br />Was it the so called ""Amazonian natives"" who looked like they were Bollywood rejects (this film was made on location in Sri Lanka), or the inept ""decapitation"" and ""castration"" scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in ""Cannibal Holocaust""? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, it appeared as though Lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending, where all loose ends are resolved. Most unsatisfying.<br /><br />As with the others, where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited (thankfully), the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk, that deal with the subject matter more convincingly.<br /><br />If there are any redeemable features at all, Kerman is an affable if somewhat one-dimensional leading man, and his bevy of scantily clad co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings.,negative";Movie
Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. This film is so bad it makes the Austin Powers films look Shakespearean. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this film? She's a good actress but is just plain terrible.<br /><br />The writing is pathetically lame. There is not one funny, clever, or witty line. There is not one good sight gag.<br /><br />The directing is terrible. Comedy relies on timing. Someone should tell the director that. Every line that is supposed to be funny (and isn't) is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing I've ever seen.<br /><br />0 stars,negative;Movie
Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story don't work and i felt its not Agatha's mistake. The cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?! The 'victim' is not likable.,negative;Movie

This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. And thats compared to Alexander, Fortress 2 and The new world.<br /><br />I should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience. For the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen TV because the actors seemed to be out of screen. I didn't think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age, i was wrong. While typing this message, I've thought of a good reason to buy this movie. A joke present at Xmas. I'm blaming the Mrs for this one as she picked it, thanks babe.<br /><br />Be warned.......A true shocker all round!!!!!!,negative;Movie
"If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's ""voice"" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.,positive";Movie
"This is one of the worst movies, I've ever seen. Not only, that it is a comedy, which isn't funny, but it's also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects.<br /><br />The two ""heroes"" with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot, that they touched each others genitals all the time. But the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal, by referring to German history and to show sensitive aspects of the ""heroes"", which finds its climax in showing how Erkan and Stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their ""joyful"" lifestyle (!). But I hadn't expect anything better by director Michael ""Bully"" Herbig, who also made two not funny TV-shows, a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny SF-comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan had been- just a little- better in some of their stand-up programs. For me the only good thing about the movie is Alexandra Neldel, who is very beautiful to me.,negative";Movie
I sat through this on TV hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time...but dear Gussie, whoever thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40's...,negative;Movie
A number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between Stewart and Novak. She was 25 and he was 50 when this movie was released. I think that the difference didn't matter for a suspense drama like Vertigo, but it does matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would be attracted to hers, but it's less clear why hers would be attracted to his.<br /><br />Still, the movie works as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where she stares at him across the cat's head, with her dark painted-on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring, is true magic. It's a little jarring, therefore, when the scene shifts to the top of the Flatiron Building, and we see the age difference very sharply. As he embraces her, she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair, but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee.,positive;Movie
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man, Daddy, has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The kids grow up,one all be it, in the hard way, to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is, the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. Yes, I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one which every young adult, and parent, would do well to see, although some will not realize it until they too are parents. A must see for those who care about their families.,positive;Movie
The only conceivable flaw of this film is it's title!! Please stop comparing it to the first! I did in my previous review only to separate it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, TOTALLY forget about the first and invent a different name for this. There is nothing alike and has a mood all its own. This is a great exponent of screwy mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first. Anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason this is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like these (i.e. adam sandler, will farrell, farrelly bros....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I dunno, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Either way, this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind 'The Stunt Man.'<br /><br />Robert Stack- WE LOVE YOU!!! (1919-2003),positive;Movie
Salva and his pal Bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives. We see them panhandling in a car of the underground, where their pitch to get donations is so lame, no one gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal doesn't even have any redeeming qualities, that is, until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on.<br /><br />He and Bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo. Salva shows he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure who is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is show's producer, can't escape from the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Ultimately, Salva is the victim of his own success in the end.<br /><br />Jordi Molla, whose first directorial job this movie is, had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, has seen its share of the bizarre, which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience.<br /><br />The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons for watching the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.,positive;Movie
"These kinda movies just don't get the credit they deserve. This is my 2nd all time favorite movie, (Stand By Me being 1st.) The reason I watched this movie was because Wil Wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and I think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did Sean Astin. I just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me. Everything in the movie is very exceptional. The script, the acting, the screenplay. I was on the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and if my mom wasn't in the room I would have absolutely balled whenever Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) died. I did not see that coming!! At all!! I was real surprised when I heard that it wasn't real popular back in the 90's. I was born a few years after it came out so, of course, I didn't go see it in the theaters, but im sure I would have if I would have been alive. If any of my friends watched this, they would be like, ""uhh okay?"" but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this. If you haven't seen this movie, or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb, this is the movie for you to watch.,positive";Movie
"As a big-time Prince fan of the last three to four years, I really can't believe I've only just got round to watching ""Purple Rain"". The brand new 2-disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to watching it, but I wasn't prepared for just how electric it actually is. Prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he REALLY has the moves in this one. I am very familiar (from repeated listens) with the classic ""Purple Rain"" album and all its songs, but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL ONES, WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself. There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform. The closing songs BABY I'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince was brimming with in his mid-20s (he's overflowing!), it blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years.<br /><br />Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake, make her jump in, then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and when his group The Time perform THE BIRD you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the stage Minneapolis funk style - I love their dancing in this bit, and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror mid-performance.<br /><br />I already can't wait to watch it again, I really can't! Extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre-Beverly Hills Cop admit he is a ""Prince groupie"".,positive";Movie
"A good ol' boy film is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a storyline that has a vague resemblance to ""plot"" and at least one very pretty country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. The pretty gal is here (dressed in designer jeans)-- but the redneck prerequisites stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff, he comes up way short. Big John is big, but he isn't convincing with the ""bad"" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a hoot as always and Bo Hopkins has been playing this same part for decades; Ned Beatty also does his part in a small role... but there is no STORY. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat Of The Night than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment. Perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is Charlie Daniels singing the theme. You know the one; it was made famous by... Jimmy Dean.,negative";Movie
After several extremely well ratings to the point of SUPERB, I was extremely pleased with the film. The film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon.<br /><br />I had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover's caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. Brian, I am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. You will go a long way, my friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club.<br /><br />Eric Etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. You made Jr. Lopez look like a child compared to Kasadya. :) <br /><br />Overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. I just wish it were longer.

"But it is kinda hilarious, at least if you grew up on Weird Al, like I did. It's a mockumentary about his life and career, beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins. It's uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, particularly when he goes to Japan. Although it's not quite as emotionally textured as Lost in Translation, and he doesn't find love however fleeting, he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is Tokyo street life.<br /><br />Perhaps Weird Al isn't recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is; perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.

One of the two Best Films of the year. A well filmed, well written, well put together film with an outstanding cast. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comedic role well (Though much like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag seems to be the foreign born Chinese surrounded by native HKers.), and I found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes, something I haven't done since 1. the fan boys took over alt.asian-movies and 2. John woo's Hardboiled. Sure the ending was expected, but I feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members. Highly enjoyable.,positive;Movie
I managed to see this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving. It was very well directed with strong imagery. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a short. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. This leans towards the Gothic feel. I would love to see this as a full feature film. -- Carrie,positive;Movie

"Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this.

it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing. The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go.

This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too memorable.<br /><br />Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. <br /><br />The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. <br /><br />NOT destined to be a great one to remember.,negative;Movie
"(Only light spoilers in here)<br /><br />Stealing Sinatra is a half-slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers, dimwit victims, and a few other side-stories thrown in to eat up some time.<br /><br />You will see some poor performances all around in this movie. The drama is forced, and the humor makes no sense. Whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won't shut up, or a victim's father responding to the criminal's death threat with ""Care for some tea?"", none of it is believable. This quite comfortably fits into the ""wannabe movie"" category.<br /><br />You will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie. It's quite unprofessional, and adds nothing. It's really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty.<br /><br />However, if you're able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief, you might be entertained by the adequate storyline.<br /><br />I voted 4/10.,negative";Movie
Yes, this is one of THOSE movies, so terrible, so insipid, so trite, that you will not be able to stop laughing. I have watched comedies, good comedies, and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea well enough. The characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on, the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge, the acting-- oh the acting-- talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses.<br /><br />But the rat, yes, the big rat. Why we didn't get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me. Often the 'big one' isn't shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money. I surmise, however, that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third-world dentistry.<br /><br />The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After figuring out that the rats couldn't stand loud noise (migraines from the bad acting?), the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy. If you've ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser, this film is for you. Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself.<br /><br />But not for more than 99¢, OK?,negative;Movie
Well where do I begin my story?? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it, and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes, what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie. The Plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast couldn't have been more plastic looking. Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker...like they dragged on for no particular reason. Very poor editing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money. Boo.,negative;Movie
This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy. One is a business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year. The other is a playboy who has tired of gold-digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital, mature woman. If you've got silver in your hair and/or romance in your heart, microwave the popcorn, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treat.,positive;Movie
"Following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such. In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet, as Che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.<br /><br />While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. This somewhat distant, cold approach to telling Che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of Che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago (excuse the ironic contrast); Che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably- conducted the whole thing.<br /><br />Yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of Cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of Bolivia for Part Two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. Here, the basic structure of Part One is echoed backthere's the initial struggle, the battles, the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them, all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement. Yet, as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know, Part Two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming, and disquieting note. This difference, in combination with the similarities to Part One, make a compelling and memorable whole; by all means, both could be digested one their own (and kudos to Soderbergh for achieving as such) and enjoyed as they are, but taken as one statement, Che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve.<br /><br />Indeed, everything that made Part One the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building, realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible, but with a feature such as this, Part Two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged. In fact, upon writing this review I was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for Part One, and title the review as a whole, yet I felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively.<br /><br />With that said, I cannot rightfully decree whether or not Che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime, but upon viewing both segments I can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that. With a reflective, intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves, Che Part Two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor, but this time with a tragic but uplifting, reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film.<br /><br />- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net),positive";Movie
Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate...............but by golly Miss Jean Peters has a lot of fun trying - and it shows,particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissable)when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face. With fifty years of hindsight Feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male - dominated society but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any such concept in their heads at the time. It was an exciting,entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions,hidden meanings or alternative agenda.It was fun. M.Louis Jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest. Mr Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor.Mr James Robertson Justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun. But it is Miss Peters who stays in the memory.Wilfully adolescent,illiterate,tough but vulnerable,wonderfully agile,and ultimately,courageous,she is everybody's idea of a lady pirate. There was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles - that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret.,positive;Movie
"I had never seen a film by John Cassavetes up until two years ago, when I first saw THE KILLING OF A Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting, to put it diplomatically, but not so special, I instantly wanted to see more of his work. Since then, I tried - with an emphasis on tried - watching his other work, SHADOWS in particular. I must admit, it took me a a while before I actually enjoyed the film. At first the unpolished, raw and improvised way Cassavetes it was shot, put me off somewhat and I thought of it as an original - absolutely - but flawed and dated experiment. But now, upon reviewing, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today.<br /><br />Shot on a minimal budget of $40,000 with a skeleton six person crew, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an African-American family in which two of the three siblings, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), are light-skinned and able to pass for white. Cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing, a reaction against 'seamless' Hollywood production values. Cassavetes main inspiration - at least in the cinematic style the film was shot - were the Italian neo-realists whilst also professing admiration for Welles' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the Italian neo-realist directors, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus ans Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything made before really. <br /><br />The song with the feathered girls, ""I feel like a lolly-pop"" (or something) feels like light years back to me, ancient history. But no matter how dated it might look, it still makes a delightful time capsule of late Fifties New York today. I think it's this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film, without Hollywood, improvised and without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims it was Jules Dassin's THE NAKED CITY (1948) that was the first and inspired them all, but I think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent American filmmakers.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 8/10,positive";Movie
"Based on an actual story, John Boorman shows the struggle of an American doctor, whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss. A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get I.D. papers from the American embassy. To fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide. ""I tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself."" <br /><br />Suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt. Just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot. In a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself. Continually her life was in danger. <br /><br />Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. This is an unforgettable story. <br /><br />""We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps."",positive";Movie
"This PM Entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make John Woo say, ""Enough already!"" Of course, it isn't nearly as beautiful as Woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is an undercover cop in the near future. When his wife is framed for murdering the Governor by a team using a look-a-like cyborg, it is up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets to pull Van Damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy failed to take notice is beyond me. Being a PM production, there are tons of car chases, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) and shoot outs. I particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck. My other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in Don's simulator. It is merely a chance to show off some cheapo LAWNMOWER MAN effects circa 1995.,positive";Movie
"SHALLOW GRAVE begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in PSYCHO. (I'm leaning toward rip off.) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the ""Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks"" genre because it is actually shot in the South.<br /><br />A group of college girls head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (Note to Yankees: stay on the highway when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangle his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Note to Yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.<br /><br />While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I've seen since Walton Goggins (Deputy Steve Naish) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.<br /><br />A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.<br /><br />And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like he's about to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for this preacher's flock. Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in Heaven.,negative";Movie
Although this film has had a lot of praise, I personally found it boring. There are some nice Brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable, but the story of how they interrelate, even if very unusual by our standards, is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long. The central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first. As the tolerance of the various men is stretched, we see their characters develop. The story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting. It is a rare glimpse into the Brasilian hinterland, far from the city, but hardly exciting enough to keep one's eyes open for.,negative;Movie
"No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for ""The House Next Door"" from her 1970s novel of the same title, or someone else did it. This Lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television. You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials, which of course, one can't find in this version we watched.<br /><br />The film's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera. That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />The film has a feeling of a cross between ""Desperate Houswives"" with ""The Stepford Wives"" and other better known features, combined with a mild dose of creepiness. The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting.,negative";Movie
Meticulously constructed and perfectly played, To The Ends Of The Earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age.<br /><br />Based on William Golding's trilogy, these three 90-minute films chronicle the journey towards both Australia and experience of youthful aristocrat Edmund Talbot (Benedict Cumberbatch) aboard an aging man o' war in the early 19th century as he heads for a Government position Down Under.<br /><br />Among the crew and hopeful emigrants sharing his passage are a tempestuous, bullying captain (Jared Harris), a politically radical philosopher (Sam Neill), a canny 1st lieutenant who's worked his way up from the bottom (Jamie Sives) and, fleetingly, the first brush of love in the form of a beautiful young woman (Joanne Page) whose ship literally passes in the night.<br /><br />Quite aside from the astonishing degree of physical historic accuracy, director David Attwood and screenwriters Tony Basgallop and Leigh Jackson have a canny eye and ear for the manners and stiff etiquette of an earlier time, crafting a totally convincing microcosm of the Napoleonic era.<br /><br />Shipboard life is one brutal, monotonous round of seasickness, squalor and danger after another and as Edmund becomes entangled in the loves, hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of life's hardships, Man's inhumanities and his noblest sentiments.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed Master And Commander: The Far Side Of The World or Patrick O'Brian's series of novels on which it was based will love this  for everyone else, it's a whole new world to discover.,positive;Movie

Would it not be for ""Grbavica"", this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin.<br /><br />Rightfully so (it was the runner-up, or second place if you will). Why? Because it is a movie about oppression. It's not even that this is a complete women issue. It is about the government trying to keep the people down.

"I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; I was, at first, a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion, and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first, but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the emotion planet, it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot. Thank god for that! Seriously, though, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it more than makes up for that with it's originality. Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema, but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what I'd choose.<br /><br />Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining. Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. This film, however, keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned), a constant stream of sick humour and a small, but impressive for the type of film, dose of suspense and tension. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. There's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough), but that's not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows. There wasn't any room for a chainsaw, which is a huge shame, but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it.,positive";Movie
"After many, many years I saw again this beautiful love story, thinking about how would I, half a century after, react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time, when I was just an male adolescent trying to understand women's behaviors, in a small city in Brazil.<br /><br />This time, however, what caught my attention in the film was something very different, namely the insistence with which the physician Dr. Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) makes clear to the journalist Mark Elliott (William Holden) her special ethically condition as an Eurasian. In fact, she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship, repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a ""occidental way"", provided that, by doing so, she is not betraying her Chinese side. Its seems to the spectator that Suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture, for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them.<br /><br />Therefore, Suyin's attitudes always leave poor Elliott  a determined, brave and extremely practical man  anxious and perplexed, without knowing how much importance to give to her words. For him, whose love for her is plain and simple, the situation is totally clear: if we love each other, let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together. ""Not so fast"", is what she seems, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time.<br /><br />In fact, Suyin's Chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism. And, as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself, she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of Chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind, namely the constant ""raids"" on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non-physical world. For Suyin is always alerting Elliott about how dangerous is life, not because of any objective and concrete threat (as would be the perpetuation of the English colonialism or the eminence of a Japanese invasion), but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor, fearful and vulnerable human beings.<br /><br />In fact, it looks like a whole bunch of Chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people's life totally miserable. Because of that, mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes, so that they are not taken away by jealous gods; everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away, in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon; peasants are advised that they should shout loudly ""The rice is bad! The rice is bad!"" to protect their crops from being stolen by deities; and, in a funeral, it is recommended that the dead's family be isolated from the other people by curtains, so that the gods don't take advantage of their sorrow and fragility.<br /><br />In other words, Suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence, as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone's daily life.<br /><br />As the story takes place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China really was, at that time, almost a semi-feudal society, while the country from which Elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that, launched by the USA after the first oil shock in 1973, took charge of the whole world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both sides of Suyin's Eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today.<br /><br />A lot of History came into being since those old days. As to China, the main fact is that, after several phases of a communist regime, the country finally reached, in the last two decades, the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as State capitalism. And, what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled Suyin in Hong Kong, in 1949, and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned Elliott, under that tree on the hill behind the hospital? It is gone, completely gone! In brief, if that story took place today, Elliott would not find it necessary to go to China to propose to Suyin in the presence of the Third Uncle and her entire family. In fact, both men would now be incomparably closer to one another, in their huge pragmatism, talking business as usual!,positive";Movie
"First and foremost I would like to say, that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual. Someone that cared about others, appreciated others, found no/barely any judgment against other people, and this film has (i think) changed my life or viewpoint dramatically. When i watched it, I didn't know particularly what it was about, i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship, but other then that I was clueless, and as I began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters, i was in shock, disbelief, confusion and surprise. The first time i watched it, i was blind. Blind to their love, to their intimacy, to their connection, to their pureness as human beings, to their relationship. I watched it a second time, because i finally figured out how hypocritical I was being, saying to myself and others, ""Oh i accept all types of people, and try not to judge them"" while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story, because of my fear I suppose. The second time I watched this film, I opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time, and really looked, not at the type of taboo relationship part that I'd heard about all my life, but simply at two human beings in love. And I loved it, i loved the storyline, i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film, i loved the sharing of feelings, and i loved the strong bonds created.

"""ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ""! If IMDb would allow one-word reviews, that's what mine would be. This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film. The singing, the story, everything is dull and washed out--just like this public domain print. Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories (such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this movie has limited appeal and just doesn't age well. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable! So my advice is DON'T watch this film. If you MUST watch an Abbott and Costello film, almost any other one of their films (except for A&C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.,negative";Movie
Once in a while, a movie will sweep along that stuns you, draws you in, awes you, and, in the end, leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form. This is not it. This is an action movie that lacks convincing action. It stinks. Rent something else.,negative;Movie
Hard to imagine this film is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart-stirring. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character. Watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience.<br /><br />The movie is not so pessimistic as I thought before, the story is kinda bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by the normals, his life is also colorful and delightful, although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes.<br /><br />One important factor of Christy's success is his mother's support which seems to be more touching, and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker also deserves her Oscar award for this role, this fat little middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christy's dream come true. So lucky for Christy!And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as young Christy, what a performance for a child! The love story of Christy is very well-done, trustful. Christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love, his crush on the beautiful Dr. Eileen Cole (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw, I am deeply impressed with her role in Harry Potter series, the loathsome Aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth...) is paranoiac and offensive, I do have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and agony are just next to each other.<br /><br />Btw, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER etc.) except GET RICH OR DIE Trying', god knows why he chose to direct that crap!

"I'm stunned that the reviewers @ IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did. It's an innocuous, sweet, uncomplicated cliché' of a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of whom did a decent job), but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels. I like a good romance as well as anyone, but as my wife and I were watching this--and before we saw the rating-we said, ""There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there's nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or their cultural preferences. It's possible to make a good film like that (and Away from Her is an example), but this was amateur hour. There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one.

Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET is the one film missing from the list you've seen. One of 4 films Scott made at RKO during his prime (1947) the others are always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just southwest of Dodge City and is a powder-keg about to explode between the trail-riders who drive the longhorns into Trail Street, the town's main street, and the sod-busters who feed our bellies. It'll take a strong man like Bat Masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order. More I won't say, except that Scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a Scott movie with confidence they'd learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this film, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many WORLD WAR II HEROS who starred in America's movies. How sad what we get these days. George Clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in 1972 in Munich and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left. I wonder how all this plays out in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal, after all, was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.,positive;Movie
I went to see this one with much expectation. Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the missing logic to character's behaviors. Today's kids need creative stories which would inspire them, which would make them 'daydream' about the events. That's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers?)

I caught this on television one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970's, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. It's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. This is the film that really got Ivan Reitman noticed as a director. Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.,positive;Movie
"The film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (U.S.). We see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. Befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. But most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself. <br /><br />I was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. Most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. It did not attempt to show how either was right, although I would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. It is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious Profesor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube, and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. Tyra Banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.<br /><br />Higher Learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. It is a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you'll find ""Higher Learning"" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10,positive";Movie
"Is rich, ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting--or more precisely, overacting--as usual? Actually, both are applicable in director Joseph Losey's wandering, meandering mess called ""Boom"", appropriately titled since tempers in the lush, luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain uninvited; she dresses him in a samurai's robe complete with saber. Though great-looking in widescreen, the picture is otherwise quite deadly, a failure even Liz 'n Dick-philes should shun (the stars' collective ""what the hell!"" attitude to their late-'60s film careers reached an ego-mad nadir here). Pointless, confused, and maddening, ""Boom"" is a catastrophe--although screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his own unsuccessful play ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"", was said to be quite fond of it! * from ****,negative";Movie
"i can't even describe it. it's the worst movie i've ever seen (i'm being a nice guy when i call it movie).Just another big-budget-made-to-someone-who-doesn't-like-to-think-much.It's not even scary. It's revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this...""thing"" to trick movie fans. I guess big producers make whatever they want.<br /><br />Just get a big producer, hot chicks (allthough horrible actresses) and a ton of horror movie clichés and cook it for a week or so, and you'll get ""The Nun"".<br /><br />And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible!!!!,negative";Movie
"The screenplay is the worst part of this film, as it lurches from one premise to the next, missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (This film is confusing, because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn't great, but this is telly, so it was fine. I don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />The prologue in particular was so poorly written, it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed, it wasn't clear what was happening, ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to ""Some riots are happening in Petersburg"", with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution, so I could fill in the details, ""those pesky Communists"". The prologue is best ignored.<br /><br />This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) It sets up a melodramatic romance, a love so strong, it'll believe anything she says. Okay, a soppy romance. No, because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally, sleazy) lunatic, bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesn't work, because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes, I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find rom-com romances more convincing, despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.<br /><br />It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is, and she struggles to prove her identity. No, the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back, again to fill in the details of a better film.<br /><br />The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life, she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next/'Twelve Monkeys'-type informant. Thankfully, she vanishes, having brought nothing to the story.,negative";Movie
Lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better. Lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original, but this time it's junior's turn, Lady and Tramp's youngster (scamp) always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him, following the rules in the house, taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy, scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose. Scamp meets another dog called Angel, they both get along fine and do the things scamp's mother and father did, having an italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc:)Afterwards, Scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal, which is the baby, scamp comes back and Angel is joined in the family.

"Wow, what's this on the video rental store's shelf in front of me? Nothing other than a questionable ""sequel"" to 8MM. It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise, its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story, even before the end is known, which makes the ending more of a possibility because I didn't believe the words coming out of David's mouth the whole time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble.<br /><br />There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the ""shocking"" moments of the film, which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this ""hellish"" sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem totally provocative.<br /><br />David was no heroic person throughout the film. You could guess he was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting ""respect."" There were plot holes (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technology moments (like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete BS, too, because it wasn't even about a last breath. Nobody really dies. But they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere...but that was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie.<br /><br />Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It has everything better about it from this film. I wouldn't recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges.,negative";Movie
Ok, honestly I dont see why everybody thinks this is so great. Its really not. There were two good things that came out of this movie 1. Jack's performance, he was very good I can tip my hat for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. No other then that it got pretty stupid. And, what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy? She was so bad. She looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this movie was the ending. I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently. And, the over all movie was just stupid. The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better. So dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off. 3/10.,negative;Movie
"This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment (but a phone that constantly rings) is somewhat interesting. And when she explores the noise, there is genuine tension and fear. But stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had.<br /><br />First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction (e.g. ""It's funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind;"" ""This door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago;"" ""The door opened by itself, without me touching it;"" etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, wouldn't she take some precaution before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the day time. Or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else. Or maybe she could TURN ON THE LIGHTS!!! Also, while in the haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide. JUST UNPLUG THE PHONE! The phone company doesn't need to be involved. Walk up to the phone and unplug it. Case closed.<br /><br />Finally, showing the phone scamper across the floor like it's alive was just comical. If the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card, he could've done it in a way that didn't look cartoony. Brave Little Toaster anyone?,negative";Movie
The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time. Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue-chip prospects and make this work of art a must-see. Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker (Home Alone: Lost in New York, A Time to Kill), Ben Johnson (The Last Picture Show, Red Dawn), and Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Village) amplify the atmosphere of the movie, drawing in an anxious audience. However, the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O. Sanders (JFK, The Day After Tomorrow).<br /><br />The story is centralized around a foster child, up-and-coming actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick, The Lookout). Sidekick Milton Davis Jr. delivers a tear-jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents. The two don't have much, but what they do have: Angels' baseball, and what they are seeking: identity. That's when 4-time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon, Predator 2) comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager, George Knox. In relation, all characters in the story seem to have the same mission: search within themselves to find out who they really are.<br /><br />Depressed over the fact that Roger (JGL) is separated from his father, he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant. Odds are astronomical, but 3-time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future, My Favorite Martian) comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic (pun). Before you know it, Al (Lloyd) is sitting with Roger in the stands, snacking on cracker jacks, and causing some of baseball's biggest boners! Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells' (DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner) 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear (nominated in Directors Guild of America). He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark, played by Tony Danza (4-time Golden Globe nominee, Emmy nominee), who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim. Clark has been dubbed a wash-up, a once big-name in Cinci, but he has something to prove to Manager Knox.<br /><br />Spoiling this nail-biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century. This one is a diamond in the rough, and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace. Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey (A Time to Kill, We Are Marshall) for all you ladies out there?,positive;Movie
"I kept watching it because it seemed like the plot was going somewhere. When it ambiguously got there I was very disappointed. I'm going to tell you what really happened in the next sentence.

I think) They sneak off after a party and do it. Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie.

"If somebody wants to make a really, REALLY bad movie, ""Wizards of the Lost Kingdom"" really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness.<br /><br />Start with the pseudo-Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white ""furry"" costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting. Work your way slowly, painfully, through more not-so-special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the heck of it).<br /><br />On second thought, skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.,negative";Movie
"A film for mature, educated audiences...<br /><br />I saw ""Random Hearts"" in an advance screening shortly before its North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.<br /><br />All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (""Star Wars,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""The Fugitive,"" ""Air Force One,"" ""Patriot Games"") is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump,"" ""Back To The Future"") in his summer 2000 thriller, ""What Lies Beneath,"" and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy's ""The Sum Of All Fears."" 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.<br /><br />Director Sydney Pollack (""Out of Africa,"" ""The Firm,"" ""Tootsie"") has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas' congresswoman. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see ""Eyes Wide Shut"" as well).<br /><br />Kristin Scott-Thomas (""The English Patient,"" ""The Horse Whisperer"") shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's quiet-man toughness.<br /><br />The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by ""Heat"" actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.<br /><br />The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's ""The Firm"") perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (""A River Runs Through It"") crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. ""Random Hearts"" is definitely one of the better films of the year.<br /><br />(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0),positive";Movie

I first remember bumping into this zaniness from the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams, back in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's) their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with bearded host.<br /><br />Capt. Frank Drebin (played by the stone-faced, dead-pan filibuster, Leslie Nielson) is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a flask full of well-known police television show plots and scenarios. This is distilled, 3 times to produce the most pure policeman every made. Forget about Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. save it for later). Frank Drebin is clueless at most times, a terrible driver, a terrible shot, macho yet sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of the police investigative methodology (a.k.a - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). This does not make him a bad cop. Cops get lucky also. Capt Drebin (notice he's a Captain here) has perfected it. Along with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of force, perfectly parody the police drama over the course of 6 golden episodes.<br /><br />The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote-ables. Most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly. The magic never came from the sight gags,however. At its core was a nonsensical and straight-faced conversation and activities in the foreground, with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as 90 minute compilations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Python's And Now For Something Completely Different.....<br /><br />If you liked Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3, or Top Secret, then you will definitely enjoy this. <br /><br />I always liked the series better than the movies, even though I saw the movies first.

A guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus. She refuses him, but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway. And there it starts - a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero. It can't be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic.<br /><br />In short, a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film. And IMO, it succeeds at being a nice film. It's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.<br /><br />So.

"The film someone had to make.<br /><br />Waco: The Rules of Engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in Waco, Texas that led to the destruction of the Branch Davidian homestead and the alleged government cover-up.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about this film: you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies. This is not done for shock value, but to illustrate points about the way they died, as if you were present at the coroner's inquest.<br /><br />The second thing you should know about this film: at two and a quarter hours, it's pretty ponderous - especially if you already followed the events closely at the time. If you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media, or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report, this may be essential viewing. If, on the other hand you want a more concise (albeit unapologetically one sided) version of events, you should see ""Waco: The Big Lie"".<br /><br />In summary, this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event, and is very sobering, but as a work of film-making, could test your patience, especially if you have a short attention span. And it's at times superfluous for those who watched the CSPAN hearings and the 60 Minutes reports.<br /><br />Perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story, such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the ATF raid or the psychological warfare tactics the FBI used blasting rock music at the sect, and their charismatic leaders (all rock musicians themselves) picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them.,positive";Movie

"Had it with the one who raised you since when you were young? You just want her gone from your life? That woman is your mother. You should respect her, you should honor her, whether she's in sick or well. But that in times, it can be aggravating. Especially when she becomes very overbearing. That's how Owen(Danny DeVito) had to deal with in ""Throw Momma Fron The Train"". His Momma(Anne Ramsey, 1929-88), is one of the worst. He trying his best to be a writer, and she is everything but grateful. Calls him a ""clumsy poop"", a ""larda$$"", and ""fat"" and ""stupid"". For his friend, Larry Donner(Billy Crystal) he has his own woman problems, his ex-wife. She trying to discredit him. So what did Owen do? Push her overboard. What does he do? Help return the favor, get rid of Mrs. Lift! In the kitchen scene, I liked it where Owen called Larry, ""Cousin Patty"". And Momma said, ""You don't have a Cousin Patty!"" and Owen shouts ""You Lied To Me!"" and El Cabongs Larry with the frying pan. Then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill Momma Lift. That is thwarted, and she kicks Larry off the train.

"Yes, it is a bit cheesy. But it's suspenseful and entertaining, and one of my favorites; there are some excellent actors in the film, and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters. It's interesting to see David Soul in a 'bad guy' role; I thought he was quite believable--and rather chilling--as the ever-more-paranoid CO. Robert Conrad is a long-time favorite--I think he brings his character to life very well; and Sam Waterston has been star quality in everything of his I've watched--movies or TV. <br /><br />I watch this movie every so often but our tape (a VHS TV copy I got) is such poor quality it's difficult to fully enjoy it.

I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on. I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John. My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant.

Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful, in every sense - emotionally, visually, editorially - just gorgeous.<br /><br />If you like movies that are wonderful to look at, and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant, I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. If you are in the mood for a really artistic, very romantic film, then it's a 10. I definitely think it's a must-see, but none of us can be in that mood all the time, so, overall, 8.75.,positive;Movie
Great premise, poor execution. Cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly edited, waste of film. Only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food.<br /><br />Joan Chen, Mercedes Ruehl, Kyra Sedgwick, and Alfre Woodard should fire their agents.,negative;Movie
Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,,positive;Movie
I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wasn't disappointed. She looked gorgeous. Second of all, through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. I kept watching until the end, but I got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.,negative;Movie
"This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat. Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap.,negative";Movie
This was my first Gaspar Noe movie I've watched and I have to say I was shocked. I don't mind gore in generally, but this isn't even gore , it's real butchering. For some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving aside these aspects, the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given, you can't stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society. The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you figure them out. Don't watch it if you want to have a lite, relaxing time. I recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema.,positive;Movie
I agree with BigAlC - this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before I went to live in Japan for a year in 1993. Tom Selleck does a fantastic job here, as always, and the movie is greatly humorous and educational. I'm a big fan of Tom Selleck's, and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part, bringing the film to life in a way I can't imagine any other actor being able to pull off. <br /><br />This film featured some first-rate Japanese actors, and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with Selleck - I can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie - Japan's an awesome place to go, whether you want to party, sight-see or just try to take everything in.,positive;Movie
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. The entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome. I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, can identify with loneliness during the holidays and/or putting up with the relatives. The best part to this film (to me anyway) were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped. Namely, the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree. Go see it and have a good laugh!,positive;Movie
"Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I moved overseas not long after, fed up with constant industrial unrest, the general worship of mediocrity - unless one is a sportsman! - and the complacency of so many Australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north. <br /><br />Consequently I missed The Dismissal, along with many other Australian-made TV dramas of the '80s and '90s, such as the superb Janus and Phoenix series, which I have since seen, along with Wildside.<br /><br />To me the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and, as far as I am aware, accurate. However, as to public ""outrage"" it only shows one side of the picture, not how families were riven by the controversy. I know, as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward. <br /><br />But the commentary is, in my view, very one-sided throughout. The inescapable fact is that, notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community, the Australian electorate chose - and chose decisively - in favour of Fraser, as they did again two years later. <br /><br />This apart, a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama.,positive";Movie

I never want to see this movie again!<br /><br />Not only is it dreadfully bad, but I can't stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick.<br /><br />Mostly I can't stand watching this terrible movie!<br /><br />Frankly, there is no reason to watch this awful film. The plot is just plain stupid.

The problem is the role of the characters in the film. Man to Man shows a British anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to Scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... The kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies... No notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... I find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the 'white mans' view,negative;Movie
"Life Begins - and ends - in a typical 1930's maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shea, as they await to give birth. While the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great-grandmothers. I found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace's (Loretta Young) husband. What an actor! As a first time father, Jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. I felt his every concern keenly. I'd like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in Gone With The Wind. In that film Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed ""Don't cut! Don't cut!"" as Scarlett fled the hospital in horror. Chilling! Another great performance is from Aline MacMahon, who plays Miss Bowers, the nurse. Her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession.<br /><br />Loretta Young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as Grace. My, she is great in these precodes, I've really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months.<br /><br />Glenda Farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste (didn't anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies' health?) but her character redeems herself in the end.<br /><br />Also in the cast was an uncredited Gilbert Roland, silent movie star, as a grieving Italian husband. His screen time was brief, but notable.<br /><br />Life Begins is a must-see precode, try to catch it sometime on TCM, but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into. 9 out of 10.,positive";Movie

I think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet-paper. No respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (that I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are that? Certainly not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic!!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism done by Serbians. A journalist like the main character ought to have known that. Thirdly, the actors playing Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs nor do they speak Serbo-croatian. All this aside, this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. At times it makes no sense whatsoever!!!,negative;Movie
*Criticism does mention spoilers*<br /><br />I rarely make user comments, but this is one movie I have no problem slandering. This movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off. Anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window). The cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think the murderer's intention was completely lost as Denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial 'chess game' and gets with his pet project, Angelina.<br /><br />If you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (like I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch-up on every single Hollywood cliche ever borne (the late-night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial-killer to prime investigator relationship, the horrible 'woman trying to get by in an all-male dominated workforce aka SOTL) , see this movie....but even then its too slow-paced and you'd be bored.,negative;Movie
"Possible Spoilers, Perhaps. I must say that ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the movie was made during the height of Disney's sequel rampage. It was created around the same time as ""The Little Mermaid II,"" ""The Jungle Book II,"" and ""Peter Pan II,"" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (Disney also made ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" and ""Atlantis II,"" but I'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place."") Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films, and I absolutely adore the original Disney ""Cinderella."" The sequel to ""Cinderella,"" however, was a waste of time. The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching. In the original, Cinderella was kind and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, ""I'm going to do this banquet my way!"" Let me also tell you that new Cinderella (as I have affectionately named her) says, ""Ewww!"" That is the anti-Cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! What the heck? Why? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: did the people at Disney watch the original ""Cinderella"" when making this sequel? Well, it surely doesn't seem so. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first one, Anastasia was evil. In the second one, she is good. One just can't leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming Walt Disney's name. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse.,negative";Movie
"Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of ""8""s, this movie's true score.<br /><br />As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King! Previous to going to see this movie I wasn't that over the top about him but now I'm banging on the doors of Chris Rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. This film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.<br /><br />There was one slight disappointment for me however. This was that in going into this film I didn't realise that it was actually a remake of ""Heaven Can Wait"" another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty. As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago.. Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.<br /><br />Well to the actual plot of the film.<br /><br />Don't spoil the experience for yourself! Don't read the plot! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets.

Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great looking Chilenian landscapes on display but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.,negative;Movie
"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money.<br /><br />Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.<br /><br />It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.,negative";Movie
"VIVA LA BAM This ""Jackass"" spin off focuses on the (obviously scripted) adventures of Bam Margera and his pals (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc). This show, while it has its fair share of gross-out comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on Bam's torturing of his parents.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say this, Bam, but... you're in no way as cool as you think you are. This ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny (and yes, I liked Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond belief. The overly stylized intro ends with Bam coolly explaining that he's going to do ""whatever the f***"" he wants to. How about you do something that is actually funny? I liked ""Jackass"" for what it was worth. The camera-work was horrible - any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents' garage - but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed.<br /><br />Not so with ""Viva la Bam"". We follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives, but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy. The stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining, but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile.<br /><br />""Viva la Bam"" is a poor spin-off of that does little good but feed Margera's already too big ego. I don't recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.,negative";Movie
"I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. Like many others on here, I don't know how to categorize this film, it wasn't scary or spooky so can't be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can't be a drama, there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words, like ""ambiguity"" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn't there. Like the Blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. This movie actually started off well with the family ""meeting"" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half the film), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. It didn't.,negative";Movie
"Schlocky '70s horror films...ya gotta love 'em. In contrast to today's boring slasher flicks, these K-tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />This is a B movie about the making of a B movie...that went horribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) stars as an over-the-hill, B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home. Her boyfriend/director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on location and on a tight schedule. The Ken doll co-star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add ""realism"". Unfortunately, ""realism"" is something they could have done without.<br /><br />John Carradine, having long since given up looking for the 17th gland (The Unearthly), now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate. He goes about his daily work, but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />The horror builds slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a grave there, finally culminating in seven, yes seven murders. (At least there's truth in advertising.) It's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie being made above him. How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work?

"I suppose for 1961 this film was supposed to be "" cool "" , but looking back now ( 45 years ) it's charm was just as silly as it's entertainment value ! Granted , the special effects do well on T.V. with the Series that started in 1964 , but for the BIG screen ?? I once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting ! I must agree about the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview. Obviously not well staged...or trained ! Overall , it's pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and I still do recommend it - for fun laughs sake. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's Biggest films and I think he thought a lot of it . Barabara Eden went on to play "" Genie "" on T.V. Micheal Ansara was her Husband .

"This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kong's 'New Wave' that began with Tsui Hark's ""ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain"". Tsui set a tone for the New Wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. ""Burning Paradise"" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.<br /><br />It's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.<br /><br />When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very incarnation of Milton's Satan from ""Paradise Lost"": ""Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven!"" And if he can't get to Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.<br /><br />That's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: It's not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. Thus there's a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.<br /><br />Of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how, see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell. Hopefully, we do not witness our own afterlives; but we certainly feel chastened by the experience - and somehow better for it over all.,positive";Movie

"This is a very noir kind of episode. It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney--daughter in law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen goes in the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. He then discovers Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect.<br /><br />This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story once again. Rocky suggests that by Jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. It's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky isn't just some clueless old man either. As he says ""You come to me because I'm your father. And I'm smarter than you!"" This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts.<br /><br />This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the ""Dark Shadows"" series and went on to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the ""Incredible Hulk"" series a few years later. She looks terrific here.<br /><br />This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family. This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend.<br /><br />Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent. I guess they figured it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. <br /><br />Not a lot of the typical ""Rockford"" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.,positive";Movie

Two from Smackdown and two from Raw.<br /><br />Shawn Michaels and Edge open up for Raw. This proves to be a good match from two talented guys. This is a match i'd recommend watching. It's hard to sum up without giving away the winner.<br /><br />Next we have the usual Undertaker against some big nasty monster, be whoever it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala... well this time it's Heidenreich. Its also a casket match. Typical Undertaker fare. Watch if you're a fan. I have to admit i am, purely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match.<br /><br />The next two matches are the title matches. For once Smackdown manages to upstage Raw. Their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable, but with a anti-climax and let down to end it. Raw's match is a pretty dull and boring affair, which is a pity as i'm a fan of both guys involved.<br /><br />Now to the main reason i love the event, the rumble. It's a pretty good one this year. Coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win, and it may not prove a big surprise, but hey, its very enjoyable. There are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated. There is the token guy who doesn't make it to the ring, the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished, and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant. It has its usual highs and lows, and i loved the ending, in particular the Vince McMahon entrance.<br /><br />I'd recommend this show. Not the WWE on top form, but its still good. Add it to your collection.,positive;Movie
"I remember this in a similar vein to the Young Ones. We'd stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other.<br /><br />We called one of our mates ""Zipmole Watkins"" after the brilliant episode in which Daniel Peacock has a bit of 'restyling' on his nose by the Back Street Abortionist.<br /><br />Lots of great lines ""Remember at 5:30 in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man. Take it easy guy!"" - Gandhi as a local shopkeeper.<br /><br />Tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching Ralph (Daniel Peacock) to be a barman ""It's no good Amanda I'll never make it as a bar man"" Helen Lederer teaches him to ask people about the match ""See the match last night? I thought Woodcock played well"" After a string of failed conversations the curly haired Arsenal star was sitting at the bar: ""See the match last night?"" ""Yeah. I thought I played well""<br /><br />We still do odd stupid lines now - ""Reg and Ralph..... or....... Ralph and Reg. Reg, Reg... Reg Reg Reg Reg""<br /><br />Lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the Flatlets - The Back Street Abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line - ""And he'll mark your packages 'Return To Sender""<br /><br />Good old Danny Peacock - you added a lot to some young drinkers' evenings sir.<br /><br />**Update - I found a couple of episodes on tape - I'm going to upload the Gandhi sketch to Youtube **,positive";Movie
Destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized. This game deserves all the recognition it deserves. At a time when first-person shooters like Quake III Arena and Unreal Tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers, graphic adventures are a dying breed. With great pun and humour, The Curse of Monkey Island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy. Life can only improve after playing The Curse of Monkey Island. *prediction* the sequel Escape from Monkey Island is already destined to be a classic too. I guarantee it.,positive;Movie
Stephane Audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community towards the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically talented sisters give-up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look-after their ageing father. One day, a French woman, Babette, comes to work for them. After some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in. Her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast, which changes the lives of all those invited. This is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from Danish to French, and especially between the dutiful sobriety of Protestant northern Europe and the sensuousness of the Catholic south. It is also about human needs, and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses. A profoundly uplifting film.,positive;Movie
"This movie was way over-hyped. A lot of the viewers, who thought this was ""amazing"" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying ""it's the greatest movie ever done"". It's just crap on a stick. It also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy. I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and I also don't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...""It will all be done on a computer"". This was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.,negative";Movie
It is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. This one came out a day before that other one with Tom Cruise. Didn't they do that with Truman Capote the same year, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting.<br /><br />Writer/Director David Michael Latt didn't have Steven Spielberg's budget and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $588 million worldwide.<br /><br />The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of Rhett Giles, who played a pastor that was giving up on his god.<br /><br />Gary Busey was creepy as an army LT.,negative;Movie
"I dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. ""Bat People"" (which I saw under the title ""It Lives By Night"") is just such a movie. You can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on ""Night Gallery"", and not one of the better ones, either. <br /><br />The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a Were-Bat who drinks human blood. (Actually, you'd think if he was turning into a real bat, he'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood's the word.) In spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, Dr. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, insists that he's just having an 'allergic reaction' to the rabies shots. Meanwhile, the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). Also meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction. <br /><br />It's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (Okay, it IS pretty bad, but it's bad in a clichéd, wooden, professional way). It's just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved.<br /><br />I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, BUT:<br /><br />1)The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT, and not just channel Dennis Weaver. <br /><br />2)He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole ""Bat Bites Human, Who Then Turns Into A Bat"" scenario. <br /><br />3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes', instead of resorting to ""Man Has A Seizure"" page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. <br /><br />4) He needed to rework the whole 'wife' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. <br /><br />I would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of Mike and the Bots. It's bad, but it isn't bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. Still better than ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Waterworld"", though.,negative";Movie
"Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing, great production, and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. The two stars work great together, and--what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting ""Irkel"" and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this film with your kids. If you don't laugh throughout it, you must not have been paying attention.,positive";Movie
Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I have appreciated throughout their careers, and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie. Well, all I can say is I totally regretted it! These two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant, unimaginative and kitch to the extreme (not that this is bad on its own)sketches that are supposed to make people laugh, but fail to do so. The only reason I can think is that the director was their friend, and they decided to support his movie by starring in it-I can't think of anything else because this movie is SO cheap! Fortunately Tim Robbins and John Cusack haven't disappointed me ever since. I would recommend you to avoid this film, unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled.,negative;Movie
On watching this film, I was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity. Karen Carpenter was a carefree, but very unconfident young lady, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs. As with all celebrities of today, they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks, styles, etc. THis had a huge effect on Karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight, which eventually caused her death. This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching. But on starting to view it, then I was hooked. In the same way that the Tina Turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. The acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it. It is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged.,positive;Movie
"Nothing is sacred. Just ask Ernie Fosselius. These days, everybody has a video camera, and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying, quickly written and shot, and often posted directly to the internet. Spoofs are hot these days, and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don't get off on their own self-importance. 25 years ago, when the first Star Wars was made, it was a different world. Filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare. Then God gave us Hardware Wars. It was shot to look cheap (or was it just cheap?) and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact. Does that take away from the experience? HECK NO! That's what makes it so great! It was raw and unpolished, and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie. From Fluke Starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber (I did that when I was young!) to Chewchilla the Wookie Monster, to Auggie Ben Doggie's ""nah, just a little headache"" remark, this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual Star Wars films. Rent it. Buy it. Borrow it from a friend. And may the Farce be with you. Always.,positive";Movie
I hated it. I hate self-aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art. This film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid. After the first half hour, I fastfowarded through the DVD version, and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over. I became angered that I had spent hard-earned money for sophomoric clap-trap. Tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie, let alone art.,negative;Movie
"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the ""house of the dead."" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it. GRADE: F,negative";Movie
If you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, anything is better than this movie. it is slow paced, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, gory, gringy, do I need to go on? It's message is good, but I have seen them been handled better in several other films. The acting isn't even any good. This movie is just even more awkward, as it start off as being funny (not intensional though)because of it's surreal story, than at the end, just becomes uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. Why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for 10 minutes, than watch them drive through a traffic jam for 20 minutes, listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear, witness a sort of rape, than see the female lead role eat her husband.<br /><br />Honestly this movie deserves nothing but a 1/10. And if your not happy with my preview,seriously I'm an open minded guy and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just awful. make any excuse you can, to avoid this film.,negative;Movie
"Good. It IS a page turner. You can read this book in one day, two at the most, and the plot drives the whole book. The unreliable narrators (there are two besides the main character) are as unlikable as they are unreliable, and there isn't a nice male in the book. Entirely plot driven; the characters are paper thin. You can figure out who-dunnit by the middle of the book. The ending is weak. I can't imagine what all the fuss is about, except that it is quick and there are lots of twists and turns, and you can't trust anyone to tell the truth.";Book
"There are no words for how much I loathed this book.  This was the first audiobook I ever listened to so not sure if something was lost in translation here, if I just disliked the narrators, or if it is truly the book I hated - but man oh man I hated this book and have no idea what the hype is about.  Maybe if I READ it I would have liked it better but none of the characters were likable, the narration was rote and emotionless, and the writing was so ... basic.  ""I sat on the bed.  I got off the bed.  I sat back on the bed.  I poured myself another drink,  I don't want to drink.  I can't stop myself.  I'm going to drink.""  Not a direct quote from the book but you get the picture.  I thought it went way longer than necessary.  I honestly can't figure out why everyone was in love with this book.";Book
"I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: ""I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember."" I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little. Oh, right, she's the woman who is responsible for the breakdown of Rachel's marriage and is now married to Rachel's ex, Tom.As others have noted, the three female characters have little to discern them from each other, and speak in a nearly identical voice - except one of them drinks. All three lament about men - constantly. They seem to have no other life interests - not one has a hobby, a job, or anything compelling her forward from day to day that doesn't have to do with a guy. (The guys all turn out to be jerks.)I suppose people like this do exist, I'm just not sure why I'm supposed to care about them - or why anyone else did, or how this book got to be so popular. I've heard it was compared to Gone Girl but other than both having a missing woman at the core, and 'Girl' in the title, there seems to be no comparison whatsoever.The 'twist' isn't a twist in the slightest, just the reveal of the missing woman's murderer, and it's exactly who, about three-fourths of the way through (and I'm not good at guessing twists), you suspect it is.  Then the 'reveal' is the guy confessing he did it in a speech you'd hear some cartoonish villain give in a super hero movie or soap opera. That kind of 'Bwahahaha I did it!' thing. Very convenient.But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was that the entire crux of the story is based on the idea that Rachel has an alcoholic blackout - and the author explains (twice) that when you are having an alcoholic blackout, your brain does not create memories - so there is nothing to 'remember'- but then lo and behold she suddenly has a memory breakthrough, and solves the crime. I thought she wouldn't have been creating memories? It's as if the author wrote half her book, then decided to do some research (googling) and when she found research that blatantly contradicted the plot point her book hinges on, decided ""Oh, what the heck, I'll keep writing"" and then decided to INCLUDE her research. And her editor didn't notice or (more likely) didn't care.A couple of other things an editor (if this book had one) should have picked up on: Much is made of a pile of clothes by the train tracks - so much so that the book opens with a description of them - the importance of the clothes? None. Zip. Zero. And there's a red haired man who keeps popping up - muttering esoteric things - we assume he will be integral to the mystery. Nope, he just disappears.Other stuff I could complain about but it would be spoilery. It seems if books are bought by book clubs, they become huge sellers, no matter how evisceratingly terrible (witness 50 Shades of Grey).Here's one thing I admire the author for: She wrote this book in four months (it shows) and it became a HUGE bestseller. Awesome for her. So few authors ever make it to that level - even with stunningly well-written books - so kudos to her for whatever alchemy happened to guarantee she's got some money to retire on.";Book
"Three disjointed characters for whom it's hard to feel sympathy or empathy as they are presented in such a superficial way you can't feel for any of them.Plot dragged on and ending was very unsubstantial - definitely not worth the ""Gone Girl"" comparisons.";Book
"Was snookered into this novel as it was compared to Gone Girl, which I liked a lot...This one is filled with dysfunctional characters who you wouldn't care to spend any time with in real life...I figured out who ""done it"" early on and by the end I imagined an alternative ending which was not a happy ending for the whole lot of them...Can't believe it remains on the bestseller list!";Book
"I'm an editor by trade, so I found the numerous run-ons a bit distracting. I also had trouble keeping track of the story when the chapters jumped back-and-forth in time; it's very easy (and a bit disorienting) to end up halfway through a chapter before realizing that scene isn't a continuation of the previous chapter, but a completely different incident taking place in the past. Girl on the Train also left too many loose ends for my liking: for example, who is the red-haired man and why was he so important to include into the story if he doesn't do anything other than show up at inopportune times and (sort of) hit on the main character?I have to wonder if the author has personal experience with alcoholism, because the way she depicted the main character's thought process was very much in line with what I've seen from recovering addicts. That part is very effectively written; at the same time, it does make the main character harder to relate to, especially if you've never experienced it.Overall, it's not a terrible book, but I don't get the hype over it. As my book club friend described it, Girl on the Train is an airplane book: fine for killing a couple hours when you're traveling and have nothing better to do.";Book
This was the most boring book I have ever read. According to my Kindle I managed 32% before I gave up. The character was lifeless, the story was lifeless and just meandered along at a snails pace. The premise was totally unbelievable unless the train moved at the same speed as the snail. No dialogue just endless narrative of something. Completely unreadable.;Book
I have to admit a prejudice: I don't like to read books where I cannot identify even one character that I like.  That is the case with this book.  All the characters are narcissistic stereotypes. That the characters are well drawn and the story well structured is all the more reason for my dislike.  I had a hard time distinguishing the difference between the two male protagonists and the three females except that the main character Rachel is less attractive and a drunk.  Of course she wasn't always that way, at one time she was...just like the other two.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the writing is done well.  I don't know if it is just my bias but I seldom find that books that are immensely popular hold up well when read.;Book
"Hmmmm, after everything I read and heard about this book, I expected to be unable to put it down. Sadly, I was only too happy to put it down -- if I could send it back and get a refund, I surely would!This is a story about a drunk and a hyper-sexed suburban housewife. First, a reader cannot really care about any of the sad and sick characters in the book; second, there is no suspense -- you know the plot line and conclusion within the first 100 pages; and third, a reader  has only one thing to sustain himself -- how long will it take the drunk to remember? It is a pointless story with prosaic prose (not a single highlighted sentence in my copy!) and paper-thin characters. II cannot think of a single redeeming quality about this book except that it did not go on any longer. Had it ended in the first 25 pages, I would have been grateful to the author for putting me out of my misery associated with buying this book!!Unless you are hankering to be bored or fall into a deep slumber while reading this book, do not buy or read it.";Book
I have heard this book compared to Gone Girl because of the unreliable narrator device. Fans of Gone Girl generally, do not like the comparison, however, I feel that it was apt. Both of the books were long slogs about characters that I did not care about at all. In order for me to enjoy a book, there must be at least one character in the book that I like. The story was not that compelling. The characters were whiny or self-serving. The pacing was glacial.I would never have picked up this book on my own after my experience of reading Gone Girl except it was a selection of my book club. Any book that is compared to Gone Girl will be a book that I will strike from my list of possible reads. Girl on a Train also has one of the worst covers that I have ever seen. The lettering on the cover is probably very effective in trying to give a feeling of motion because it gives me motion sickness every time I look at it.This book was not an enjoyable read for me. I don't like unreliable narrators. I don't like books filled with unsympathetic characters. I don't like books that flip back and forth with time. I cannot recommend this book to anyone unless you enjoy the things that I don't.;Book

I have just started reading e-books and thought I'd try this since I had a bus ride to take and the other book I am reading is 4 inches thick. I don't like books with prologue sections that try to hook you and leave you waiting half the book -- or more -- to find out what that was all about, but this one was brief, so onward.  I think I read the whole first chapter before starting to flick quickly through the screen pages:  Boring, flat, self-pitying, boring, paralyzed, nothing happening, how many pages devoted to Rachel's drinking and phone calls?, boring. . . .Anna, who cares?. . . Jess who is not Jess. . .Eesh. I gave up. The tone is very flat, even when the narrating character changes. I found myself wondering if this was indeed a mystery. Amazon has just informed me that it is. . . but the only mystery to me is why this book has been so successful.;Book

I don't understand the hype around this book. I can't finish it, let alone recommend it. I've forced myself to read half of it, but have given up -  it's just too annoying. It is well-written from a technical standpoint, but just drags along, with the narrator droning on about her failed marriage, drinking problem and depression. I wouldn't want to put up with her in real life, so I certainly don't want to waste time reading about a fictional character like this. Maybe she shakes it off in the end, but I don't care enough to find out.;Book

Well, it is a compelling mystery. But all the characters are quite unlikeable. Everyone of them is so deeply flawed and make such rotten choices. Again and again and again. It got quite tiresome. I'm giving it three stars because its an easy read and the story is engaging - in a guilty pleasure kind of way...a lot like those aweful choices in the story. I just kept reading.;Book
This book was recommended by a friend who described it as impossible to put down. I read it fairly quickly and though I agree the story builds quickly and relentlessly -- but the story is dark and, for me, without reason or purpose. I found the main character troubled but mostly unsympathetic --damaged without the author offering much in the way of why. In fact most of the characters ranged from unsympathetic to pathological. One-dimensional -- completely self-deluded, completely self-absorbed -- completely psychopathic. Unsettling just for the purpose of building suspense. This is not a book I would recommend.;Book

The character development is weak--and I don't like any of them. It's B-O-R-I-N-G. I would advise you to skip this book and save your money...but obviously some other people like this book. I just don't know why!!!;Book
I really did not enjoy reading this at all. If it wasn't for the movie that is coming out soon, I honestly would have quit reading very shortly after starting. It's, in my opinion, very exaggerated in the way it plays out the plot. I lost interest a few times, especially with how annoying the main character is. None of the characters are likeable, or supposed to be likeable, which I get, but it leaves the reader unable to connect to the main or even supporting characters in the book. A lot of the actions felt extremely forced, like they had to be created for the story line so the situations came off unplausible. I found myself bored more than once, and truly celebrated being finished with it. I gave it two stars instead of one, because at least it had a good editor and satisfying(ish) ending.;Book
I was intrigued by the beginning, but is anyone else seriously disappointed in the last 1/4 of the book?  SPOILER ALERT: Do not read further if you have not read the book!Really?  Two men on the same block who physically abuse the same two women in the same exact way?  It seems like there wasn't too much thought put into the male characters, and the last quarter of the book doesn't feel organic -- it feels contrived and forced.The female lead's actions at the end also make her incredibly stupid.  If you figure out that someone is a killer, you DO NOT physically go to that person's house and tell said murderer that you know what happened.  I can understand if these people were teenagers, but in their 30s?  Seriously?  Greatly disappointed.;Book
Everyday, Rachel takes the train to work. As the train comes to halt at a signal, she daydreams about the people in the houses she sees. She watches the moments of their lives that she observes from the train, and she makes up stories about them. This is merely daydreaming, until the day she witnesses something. Then, everything changes!As I read this, I kept thinking about that voyeuristic quality that I enjoyed in Hitchcock’s REAR WINDOW. We all seem to enjoy looking into other people’s lives and catching a glimpse of what a stranger’s private life might be like.This book kept me guessing until the last minute. Because the author narrated different chapters in the first person by three alternating characters, we are able to get to know them from the inside out, understand how their minds work, and see how they evolve as the tension of the murder mystery builds. This is a very clever way to both allow the reader to relate to the characters and their feelings, as well as to tell a story from varying viewpoints. I bet you can’t put this one down! I couldn’t!;Book
"4.5 starsCan't really explain why this story grabbed me like it did. On the surface, it doesn't seem like it should have.  It's told in first person, which I prefer, but in present tense, which I hate.  I can understand the comparison to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which I loved, in that the characters aren't the least bit likable or the kind of people anyone would want to be friends with. Rachel is weak and whiny, Anna is self-absorbed and stupid, and Megan is self-indulgent and reckless. All three are ridiculously juvenile. There's very little dialogue, a huge part of the narrative is backstory, and one of the characters is constantly blacking out and remembers nothing, which I found not all that believable. Then there's the fact I guessed early on ""whodunnit"".And yet, it was a remarkably gripping read.  I was compelled to finish.  I wish I could put my finger on why.  You'll just have to dig in and see if it grabs you, too.  But know this, I am a very difficult reader to satisfy, but this book was strangely gratifying.";Book
"I am surprised this has been on the best seller list for so long.  I have read many better  written books over the years and this does not rank in the quality for a ""Best Seller"".  Neither did the ""Gold Finch"" which makes me skeptical of buying supposed best sellers.";Book
Well, it is a compelling mystery. But all the characters are quite unlikeable. Everyone of them is so deeply flawed and make such rotten choices. Again and again and again. It got quite tiresome. I'm giving it three stars because its an easy read and the story is engaging - in a guilty pleasure kind of way...a lot like those aweful choices in the story. I just kept reading.;Book
"Wasn't my favorite. I read it after ""The Husbands Secret"" as it was one of the recommended based on the books.  The first few chapters were a bit of a hard read to get through.  I had to keep switching back and fourth between the chapter I was reading to the chapter prior to it to remember the names and characters mentioned already.  I was pretty annoyed with the main character and everything about her.  From the first chapter she was introduced I was like ""ugh"".  She reminded me of a Jenji Kohan character, someone who just does stupid stuff all the time but yet remains in the lead. Just wasn't all the ""hype"" I was expecting.  The best part of the book when I was actually enjoying it was the last 2 chapters.  Prior to the last chapters I was just struggling to get through it and forcing myself to finish it only because I paid for it.  I hate starting books and not finishing them.  I'll finish the worst book even if it takes me 10 months off and on because I don't like leaving books unfinished.  Simply ok. Nothing amazing.";Book
Rachel, still raw after her divorce, travels past her former home twice a day on the commuter train. She becomes interested in an ideal couple living in a house a few doors down from where she used to live, concocting an idyllic life for the two.  Then the wife disappears, and Rachel finds herself obsessed with the mystery -- where has she gone? What has happened? Can she help the grieving husband find answers and deflect suspicion away from him? Convinced she has seen things from the train that give her extra insight into the couple, she inserts herself into the investigation. Meanwhile Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife, contributes to the narrative, giving us a different view of Rachel and her motives, and making no bones about the fact that she views Rachel's intervention as an attempt to stalk her family.  In chapters alternating between Anna, Rachel, and Megan, the woman who has disappeared from her perfect life, the book gives us 3 different points of view of the story -- none of which prepares  us for the book's shocking finale.;Book
Ugh. So many glowing reviews, so much hype, a forthcoming movie... Color me confused. (Well, not on the movie bit -- doesn't take a good story to make a few bucks from a moving picture show).I was expecting something groundbreaking, or at the very least, something original. You'd think I'd learn not to put so much stock into reader reviews, and that even the NYTimes and NPR aren't always on target with their literary praise, but, alas, I bought into the hype.The story was banal and dull, and frankly, rather juvenile in form. There's nothing interesting or exciting in the writing style (I feel like you have to be REALLY good to pull off first-person -- it wasn't successful here), and at no point did the author convince me to care what happened to the characters (which is funny, because I'm a 30-something female who could (in theory) relate to some facets of the characters' lives).There's nothing compelling about this book, and it is an absolute mystery to me why so many glowing reviews!I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't even download the Kindle preview first. Looking for a good, late-summer read, I saw the great reviews and grabbed the whole book. My dumb mistake! You'd think I would have learned to always get the preview -- it is, after all, what saved me from the awful writing of EL James.;Book
I finally succumbed and bought this book to see what all the hoopla was about and, no, I haven’t seen the movie. I found it to be a super entertaining read. I finished it in the ‘wee smalls,’ unable to put it down. What I really liked about it was that though I thought I’d figured out who the evil doer was at the very beginning, the author kept leading me astray … so that I abandoned my first impression only to be surprised at the end when I found that I was right from the start!The story is told from alternating points of view which I liked, too.The novel is dark and fast-paced, the characters are complex and the plot is compelling. Highly recommended for thriller fans. Five big, bright, shiny stars;Book
I had to read this book for a book club. If you spend most of your time voyouristically watching the lives of others rather than living your own life, if you love drunks and the havoc they wreak in your life and their's, if you adore weak, pathetic women who climb into a bottle at the first inkling of duplicity by their husbands, if you have a soft spot for good looking psychopaths, if you keep falling for weak men, by golly this is the book for you. The three-way point of view is a stupid contrivance for a pathetic storyline. The only character I liked or respected was Evie. Although she had no dialogue, she had the good sense to remain quite at critical times in the story. If this is the best Paula Hopkins can write, she has my sympathy. And, if the next generation really is similar to these characters, then God help us all. We're doomed.;Book
If you're wondering what the international ruckus is about this book, don't. I regret having squandered precious time on this overrated bestseller. The novel is simplistically written, predictably plotted, and littered with self-obsessed, uninteresting characters.;Book
"After such great reviews I had hope this would be a good book. I like books about imperfect people; Gillian Flynn books or Bingham's Fiona Griffiths are my cup of tea. But, this is a book about stupid pathetic people, I don't have the patience for that. I did finish the book though and I am not disappointed that I read the book. I am glad I did, so I can tell you not to rely on the good reviews too much. Get it from the library to be on the safe side.";Book
Where do I begin? So, you have a women who's lost everything, fakes going to work, has a drinking problem, creates a story in her head about a couple she watches from a train, still obsesses over her ex-husband, claims to know the missing women in the story when she doesn't, starts seeing one of the suspects so she can try to be a private eye, sleeps with...Man, this women needs a life!I was super excited to check it out but quickly became extremly dissapointed. The pace was slow, the repitition was annoying, could had done without all the internal dialouge, the chronological order threw me off and as much as I wanted to I could not feel for any of the charcters.Sighs...;Book
Like the outdated train tracks that Rachel rides across every day, what was billed as interesting is actually tedious and boring.  The books repetitive plot devices have been done to death.  It doesn't even hold up well enough to be a guilty pleasure or a campy beach read.  Its not a particularly good escape because there is nothing about her world that makes you want to be there.  Rather the story grates on in an irritatingly self-absorbed fashion....much like Rachel making yet another justification to herself to have yet another drink or three.And ike a drunkard's ramble, the story stumbles around until it reaches the end with a final, unsastisfying, meh.;Book
First off, I enjoyed this book. The plot was good. The pacing was good. The limited, first-person points-of-view is an effective mechanism for this story. I did figure it out, but I did not nail it down too quickly. I was definitely interested to see how it resolved. The characters, however--except for maybe two--are not exactly relatable. Each is thoroughly flawed with minimal self-awareness or empathy for anyone else. I suppose if you put enough self-absorbed folks within proximity of one another, something's bound to happen. It does! Trying to figure out what that something was and who did it was good fun. I might have liked actually liking somebody involved in all that mess, though. (Or maybe it's better that I didn't.);Book
There has been much talk about this book and being a fan of thrillers I couldn't wait to read it. I found it tedious and hard to get through. The two stars are for the way the author crafted the story and the skill used in making all her characters so utterly pathetic that i didn't care what happened to any of them and I wanted them all to meet their demise by the end. I can see why people liked it as unpredictable, I wasn't surprised by the end though I was hoping for it.;Book
"I finally had to stop reading this book, a rarity for me.  I generally slog on, figuring that eventually everything will come together and it will be worth the parts I didn't enjoy.  This book, however, just didn't engage me.  I didn't like the characters and I couldn't get into the story.  I've read a lot of books where the protagonist's self destructive behavior and addictive personality are woven into the story.  However, in this case, she just seems sort of pathetic; I can't work up any empathy for her and finally, I just didn't want to read any more about her.  The other characters were sort of slimy as well.  Obviously others don't share my view of this book, but hey, that's why we have so many authors in the world!";Book
Knowing this book was a best seller and had been made into a movie was what attracted me.  As probably all mystery/suspense genre readers do, I speculated on who might be the bad guy (nothing personal, fellas), and found myself waffling.  I did not, however, find the writing or story development as enchanting as the rest of its readers must have.  In my experience, the movie is never as good as the book.  This may be an exception.;Book
"You know those movies, where there is a perfectly normal character who then, in the final act,  is suddenly revealed to be a psychopath?  Who, instead of killing the person who has figured it out, incredulously decides to confess to them everything they did and why they did it?  It is that cliched plot device that gives the cornered ""good guy"" the opportunity and the time to thwart the ""bad guy.""  It is lazy and uninspired writing, and it left me feeling cheated.This book commits the cardinal sin of writing.  It tells the story instead of showing the story. I'd wait for the next train if I were you.";Book
I finally decided to start putting down the iPad and get back to print. This was one of 3 recent book orders. Love the story. The quality of the book and print is HORRIBLE! Not sure who's manufacturing but you should never use them. Print is so bad I can't read some pages. My eyes are bad enough, I don't need a book that creates double vision! Paper is not bound well. Book will surely fall apart before I'm done. How disappointing! But, this is a first so not giving up on print yet!;Book
I couldn't wait for this book to come out. It was such a disappointment. This was probably the darkest book I've ever read. Just when I thought It couldn't get any darker, it did. There were only five main characters. Not only were they all dysfunctional but it was hard to keep them straight. When the story was being told from each respective character's point of view, the writing tones were all the same and sometimes it was hard to determine who was actually doing the talking. But, I didn't give it up and finished it to its dark ending. There was absolutely no uplifting parts to tis book.;Book
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)";Book
I don't know why we have this morbid fascination with murdered young women, but we do, and with all the good and mediocre novels on the subject, this one stands out as superior. It is very clever and fast-paced with a unique twist. The main character, Rachel, who has been deeply wounded by betrayal in her marriage, has become a bitter, jealous drunk, and yet she is totally lovable. When she is not harassing her ex and his new wife, she is watching the lives of others out the window of the train on her daily commute, and living vicariously through them. Until something happens that changes several lives. And Rachel saw something significant, but she can't remember what it was because she was in a blackout. Read it. You'll love it.;Book
I was really excited about this one, as so many people were raving over how good it was at the time I read it. Unfortunately I found it hard to get into – nothing much happened in the first 100 pages. Characters were too depressing and pathetic. Not really fond of novels where woman are written as victims who don’t do anything to help themselves, even when they start to figure out somethings wrong. Mystery wasn’t that clever or original. Liked her writing style so will try her next book, but hope it’s better than this one.;Book
Terrible, can't understand why it is on the bestseller list .;Book
According to other reviewers, The Girl on the Train was compared to Gone Girl.  This is NO Gone Girl!  About 1/2 way through the book, I realized who dun it.  From that point on, I found the content to very redundant and 'spoon fed' to me.  I also thought there was a slightly significant difference between actual text at the end of the book and a scene leading up to the end.  Without giving too much away, the discrepancy specifically involved reference to a corkscrew,If you want a REALLY good read like Gone Girl, read Sharp Objects (or even Dark Places) and skip reading The Girl on the Train.As far as the author's writing it is somewhere between ok and good.;Book
"I almost stopped reading it by chapter 3 - but it was suggested I finish it ""it will get better""  It didn't...was a waste of time and very disappointing.  A one star is too much for this.  I'd rather read a cereal box.";Book
I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!;Book
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel.";Book
"There's nothing particular that I can point out about why I hated this book.  I did finish it, just because I wanted to find out if Rachel was truly as crazy as I thought she was (she is).  I bought this based on ""if you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this"".  The only thing this book has in common with Gone Girl is that the main character was absolutely batshit crazy.  She's developed, but predictable.  She continually gets drunk, feels bad about it, then makes the same mistakes over and over again.  She is continually abusing the people in her life who are just trying to help her.  The ending did take me by surprise for about 3 sentences, then I figured out exactly what was going to happen.  Again, this is by far not the worst book I've ever read, but don't plan to read anything Paula Hawkins ever writes again.";Book
For once the movie was pretty close to the same as how the book was laid out, with the book of course always going into more detail because you have the narrative to back up the storyline. I do think having watched the movie before reading the book helped because the book switches back and forth many times between different timelines that would have otherwise been confusing to keep up with. Overall I was not disappointed with the book and had been wanting to read it for quite some time, glad I did.;Book
I really enjoyed reading this novel.  I appreciate novels that spend time developing character and this one did. Telling the story by weaving the tale together by proving us with seeing things from the aspect of the characters involved adds to the readers enjoyment by providing more mystery to the tale. In addition, I enjoy stories that show flawed characters, which we all are, and this one had its share.  ...and, as always, the book was a lot better better than the movie.;Book
Here we go again I thought,when I was reading about a young girl,she feels she is not longer desirable,because she off-putting in some weight,divorce,alcoholic,lost control of her life, misery,loneliness,mentally unstable,almost stop reading this great book,is very interesting keep you in suspense,I didn't do nothing all day,I can't put it down,is so good reading,I didn't waste my day,this book is worthy my time,ha ha ha, I recommended you will like it a lot,I give 5 stars because keep me like a glued,and that is something that makes me happy,Thelma.;Book
This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later.;Book
The inner thoughts in this book are compelling narratives by women who act badly and hate themselves for it. Unremitting self-destructive thoughts, abuse of themselves and getting themselves abused by others, and alcohol dominate their lives. The plot  is a very intelligently constructed mystery that depends on these women being the way they are, and their struggles to escape their nature. A very satisfying read.;Book
The only reason I didn't stop reading this book after the first 100 pages is because I kept thinking surely this novel will pick up it's pace at some point.  Not this novel.  Slow moving, very predictable and lame.  The one positive I can say is good character development.  I do not recommend this novel.;Book
I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!;Book
Rachel, an obsessive alcoholic who has blackouts, is struggling with life after divorce and sinking further and further into oblivion.  She becomes involved in a missing person case that she witnesses from a train and the case gradually takes over her life.I was torn between giving this book five stars or one star.  Why?  Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.  Something different.;Book
"OK, I know it's only February, but I read a lot -- usually at least 3 to 6 books per month. I read this novel more slowly than normal, savoring the storyline, the prose, the character development. I found the concept of the storyline original and intriguing, the characters believable, and the ending surprising (so to the reviewer who expressed boredom and disappointment with an obvious conclusion, um, maybe you should be a detective or a mystery writer 'cuzl I so did not see that coming!) I was immediately drawn in and caught up in the story, and stayed up too late reading on more nights than is good for me if I want to keep my job. I found Ms. Harkins's writing entrancing, and even the shifting points of view and jumps back and forth in the chronology didn't bother me; rather they added a dimension of realism to the inevitable unreliability of multiple narratives.I'm not going to rehash the plot yet again. Yes, Rachel is a fall-down blackout lying drunk who's stalking her ex husband. Does that make her unsympathetic or unlikable? Maybe. She's also a disillusioned woman who has never fully dealt with devastating losses in her life. Which probably have contributed to her becoming a fall-down blackout lying drunk. (Yes, I know that's a sentence fragment.) Or, perhaps I just liked her because I used to be a fall-down blackout lying drunk with stalker tendencies. And, I guess the fact that I didn't foresee the ending can be attributed to brain damage from all that alcohol consumption.Anyway, I loved the book and didn't want it to end. I highly recommend it to fans of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. If you're an Alfred Hitchcock addict, as I am, I think you'll enjoy this novel.";Book
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.;Book
The Girl on the Train is like no other book I have ever read before. Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one. I highly recommend this novel to everyone, regardless of your preference in literary genres.;Book
I really enjoyed the way the tale is told from the perspective of the three women. It held my attention while tempting me, consistently, to ponder the next turn and unfold the connections and clues that take the reader round the next corner of the story. After finishing the book I rented the movie and found it to be an awful interpretation.;Book
Wow! I loved this book and to think that I almost didn't read it. For whatever reason, I had a hard time connecting with the book in the beginning, but kept at it at the insistence of so many friends. I am so glad I did. It was slow at the beginning, but it paid off in the end. The book is told from the point of view of three different women. The unreliable narrator tactic worked well with the way the author told the story from different dates. If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book. I don't see how my review is even necessary or helpful considering how many reviews this amazing book and author already have, but I wanted to share anyway. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down and had to know what would happen next. I guessed who the killer was, but I don't think that means anything. The book is a psychological thriller not a mystery so the suspense comes from wondering if our MC will escape the dangers posed by the villain and not from solving the mystery of who dun it. It was a nail biting experience at the end as I worried for two of the main characters and wondered what would happen. I can't say more without giving it away.If you are one of the few who has not read this book, you simply must read it. Please don't let the slow start put you off. You will see, soon enough that it was worth the wait. This novel is unique and not like any other book out there. It shares many of the same plot techniques and narrative as Gone Girl, but the story is completely different from Gone Girl and from any other book. That's what makes the book such a hit.If you have read this book and loved it like I did, I highly recommend that you read, Peter Swanson's The Kind Worth Killing. It hooks you much quicker and it is every bit as good as The Girl on the Train. Both are at the top of my all time favorite books. You can read my in depth review of The Kind worth Killinghttp://www.melissasugarwrites.com/2015/05/the-kind-worth-killing-review-with.html;Book
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.;Book
This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it.;Book
This novel is written in first-person of three women, which provides the tension and perspective. The premise is engaging, and I was most intrigued by the insight it offers into the struggles of addiction. I have experienced the same cycling and thought patterns that the narrators are subjected to. The author either has been there herself, or is intimately acquainted with such persons.Though the story drags a bit occasionally, it will keep you reading to the end.;Book
I couldn't put this book down once I really got into it.  I especially liked the last third of the book.  I loved the use of multiple narrators.  The book has inspired me to begin working on my first book.  Of note, I may be guilty of liking the book's style more so than the actual story or characters. Sue me.;Book
I kept reading hoping that I would get to the end ASAP.  I got tired of all the jumping around with flashbacks and then back to the present as well as jumping from character to character trying to keep them straight.  I just wasn't worth it to me to have spent so much time on such a disappointment.  I believe that there might be some readers who would find the book passable, but i did not.;Book
I have only read about 22% and am so bored I have gone on to another book.  Sorry I bought this book;Book
Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end.;Book
Let me start by saying, I don't understand the hype of being riveting. Before you get upset, this is not a slam or bad review. I did rate it four stars! This is my honest review and I didn't find it riveting.I did, however, find that it was very well written and intriguing. I was about 3/4 of the way through the book before I something crucial clicked and once it did, it all made sense.It did take me several chapters to realize it was bouncing timeframes. I had gotten really confused until I went back and double checked the dates. Things fell into place better after that.I got quite angry at Rachel but that was the nature of her character. The book elicits most of the correct feelings and moods as it should but I wasn't riveted to it and it took me longer than it should have to read it. The one thing I didn't feel enough of, or any, was dread. There should have been a great deal of dreadful feelings with a sense of foreboding. It just want there for me, maybe I read too many suspense/mystery/thriller novels to truly appreciate this book.Those are my Novel Thoughts, though I can't guarantee a Happily Ever After.;Book
"Pay attention to the chapter titles!  I was completely confused for the first third of the book, but once I understood it not only changed chronological order but also the first person telling the story with each chapter, it all made sense.. .to the point that by the end I almost knew ""who dunnit"".  Overall good story and well written.";Book
This book was a selection of my book group. It did not particularly interest me but my husband thought it sounded interesting and we like to read together. So we read the Kindle edition which did not have actual page numbers, and used the percent read to keep track of our progress. Somewhere around 80% our persistence to finish the book began to pay off. Both of us are glad to have it finished.;Book
This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It’s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that’s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel’s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can’t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn’t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It’s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel’s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel’s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she’s admiring her and Tom’s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I’m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her “I don’t care about anyone but me” attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she’s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan’s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn’t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There’s good and bad. It’s a confusing mess and I wasn’t always sure which man I was reading about through these women’s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It’s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn’t until about seventy percent through that I said, “Ah-ha!” I’m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn’t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don’t lie and don ‘t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age – it’s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality – for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren’t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn’t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I’m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect.;Book
I didn't like this book. Sometimes less is more and it's annoying when a villain explains all their motives before they kill someone. Pretty much how this book ends and it reminded me of a silly scary movie.;Book
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away.";Book
Just finished reading this amazing thriller. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie and I am so glad that I did. It kept me up several nights past my bedtime because I just couldn't put it down. The story line was amazing and I swear I thought almost every character was the killer at one point or another. Definitely picked my brain. Would totally read another book by this author. It's now on my list of favorites, right up there with Gone Girl!;Book
I was contemplating to skip this review. I don’t like to be negative, just because it may not be my cup of tea. In a real life I practice a rule, what I don’t understand, I simply respect, instead of judging it.This is a book review site, and I feel I have to stay true to its purpose.I was very excited to read this book after all the commercial hype about it. I have to admit that I set myself for a real disappointment. I will try to stay constructive and short.CONS:Title - The word ‘girl’ is completely wrong for a divorced thirty something WOMAN.Plot - Predictable, similar concept “Lady on the train” 1945.Characters - Three messed up women, two abusive men. All narrators speak in first person.Ending - Completely flat, fell apart.Pace - First half very slow.PROS:Writing - Paula Hawkins has a unique narrative structure.To me this wasn’t really a mystery, more like a character study. I don’t mind depressing, negative or dark, but non of the characters were likable enough to root for them.;Book
Fabulous. Long & slow going, actually, but every step of the way hypnotic. The tiny details of human character, that's what pulls you on. These characters at first seem so mundane & ordinary, but what explosions lie within each of them! This whole story is like the peeling of an onion, revealing more and more, until you don't want to look anymore, but are compelled to. Sensational!!;Book
I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away.;Book
I still don't get it.  I tried to like this story because it was such a big best seller, but just couldn't get into it and was not at all drawn to any of the characters or their unique situations.  Probably the best part was the end, which exposed a maniacal killer.  I realize the narrative is British, but the author could use some grammar checks.;Book
It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type.;Book
"Put aside plenty of time to read this book.I am always looking for books that are character driven.  The main protagonist is damaged, broken and an alcoholic.  She is not someone that welcomes warm and fuzzy moments.  Her life has been spiraling out of control for some time.  Her choices and habits come back to bite her on a regular basis.It took a while for me to engage with this character.  As an addict in recovery, this book cause me to squirm quite a bit.  I've lived her story in many ways.  I had to overcome my comfort level to continue to read this book.  I am glad I did.There are so many layers to this book.  It is the proverbial onion, complete with aspects that sting the eyes to near tears.The plot has so many twists and turns.  It is very much like that rollercoaster that you avoid at all costs.  Your friends and family tease you, prod you, yet you steadfastly say never.  Next thing you know, you are on that rollercoaster, unsure the bar across will hold you in.  After wards, you are asked whether you enjoyed it.  With a wry smile, you say quietly, ""Yes, yes I did.""The many reviews of this book may not do it justice.  I suspect the intrepid reader will find within its nooks and crannies a very satisfying read.";Book
No wonder they made a movie from this book. It was a great story! Characters developed as you turn each page, and the plot was thick with mystery, betrayal, love, heartbreak, murder, and it was an awesome thriller!;Book
Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie.;Book
While Rachel is not the most sympathetic protagonist (drunks usually aren't) her story is a fascinating one. Interesting approach in this book to weave the viewpoints together of the major participants. Lots of false leads, red herrings, and the self centered perspectives that people often have combine for an interesting mystery and a fascinating read.;Book
Couldn't stop reading<U+200B> it to see how it ended but it was not an enjoyable read. Not one character was likable. Ending not terribly satisfying either.;Book
I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore.;Book
"One of the better ""whodunits"" I've read in recent years.  The economic and social strictures of post-Thatcherian suburbia set the background for this surprisingly powerful novel about a ""girl"" (unemployed) on a ""train"" (daily commuter run) who has little better to do than shuttle back and forth from home to London -- and muse about the life she wished she'd had.  Not fast, but compelling.  The characters are not chock-full of surprises until the very end of the novel, but they are moved along well enough by author Paula Hawkins. Narration and dialog are British, of course, but not so tough as to move us Yanks to the urbandictionary more often than occasionally.If, indeed, you liked the book/movie GONE GIRL you will probably like this one too.";Book
"How does a writer get me to feel empathy for a lying, busy-body, pathetic drunk? Rachel had a nice life in the suburbs until difficulty conceiving drove her to drink—in excess! To the point she lost everything. She’s obsessed with her ex, even though he has moved on with another wife and child. Now she’s become obsessed with a couple she sees from the commuter train. She’s given them names and created a fairy tale life for them. Until the day she sees something that shatters the illusion.This suspense has everything. The characters are well-developed; the pace moves along; there are plot twists throughout. It kept me guessing. This is a hard-to-put-down novel. I didn’t want it to end!";Book
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!";Book
Flat, predictable, poorly written. I'd have dropped it midbook (which I almost never do) had it not been part of a book club.;Book
What I found interesting about The Girl on the Train is that it is told by 3 unreliable female narrators, each of whom is quite unlikeable. In fact, the cast of characters in this book is fairly small and there’s not a likable character in the bunch. Is it weird of me to say that it was almost a relief to not feel like I had to root for anyone? The women all become more sympathetic by the end of the story, but overall it was fun to read a book that I didn’t want to put down without having any emotional ties to any one character.I found this book to be fairly fast-paced and without much extraneous plot that wasn’t related to the mystery. I couldn’t put it down because I just had to know how it ended. Whereas I found myself baffled by the lack of a decisive ending in Gone Girl, this was not the case in The Girl on the Train and I appreciated that a full story was told from start to finish, with no open questions remaining.It’s an intriguing mystery that will be just as good as you pass the time on a cold winter’s night as it will be this summer on the beach.;Book
"Dull, tedious & the ""plot twist"" was yawn-inspiring. Let's just say I wasn't expecting a 300 page diary of a drunk woman.";Book
I admit it was slow at the start. But once you were caught in the web of the story, there is just no letting go. The layers are exceptional, and the story unpredictable. I really enjoyed this book and in the end couldn't put it down. Absolutely wonderful.;Book
Not bad novel. Wanted to read it before watching the movie. After reading the book don't think I will bother watching the movie. Not my kind of story.;Book
It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie.;Book
I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!;Book

For a debut novel, it was a brilliant depiction of the most basic elements of fallen human nature--envy, greed, lust, deceit, all tied in with murder, emotional and sexual hunger, and obsession on a grander scale.I am thankful to my new favorite author, Paula Hawkins, for:1) Not giving us a Gone Girl ending, especially with all the main characters' aversion to truth. This type of unpredictability suited Gone Girl because of the utter vileness of the ''heroine,""and we know that life never turns out the way we want, and sometimes evil triumphs over good. But I think letting Rachel live and killing off Tom finally gave the reader some breathing room to say, ""Finally. Something goes right."" (Or at least that's what I say, given that I felt like I was reading the book on a fast-paced train with my pulse beating fast and heartbeat ricocheting in my chest.)2)Giving me a character I can relate to. Only instead of alcohol, I'm addicted to caffeine. I felt that Rachel Watson was somewhat of an extension of me. We're both curious, (need to know), we're both driven by a sense of doing what's right (if you see something, say something), although I don't know if I would have had the nerve to do what she did, we've both said our share of ""I'm sorry"" to people we love (after acting similarly), and we're both fat. Instant buddies for sure. Throughout the novel, she makes stupid decisions (just like I do), but I found myself feeling protective of her. I did not want her to meet Megan's fate. So thanks to Ms. Hawkins for giving me a new best friend.3). Writing a book with a potential for changing lives. At the core of this novel is this undeniable theme: We are all only humans. We have our successes, our failures. Our strengths, our weaknesses. We are individually different but together all the same. All of us have hope of redemption. Rachel was an alcoholic until she realized the value of memory over apologizing for things she doesn't remember. Anna liked being the homewrecker until she found out the train wreck her life had become with Tom's infidelity and her ex-nanny's betrayal. For some, redemption was too late. Megan and Tom wanted something they could not obtain in their own lives so they reached out to each other for a temporary pleasure, which inevitably costs them their lives. Though the reality of my life is nowhere nearly that drastic, I can honestly say that I am somewhat changed by the lessons in this novel. It has touched my heart in ways that only truly great literature can.Though I'm sad at the end of this journey and that I have to debark, I hope other readers will get the chance to ride this fast-paced thriller on wheels, accompanied by suspense and page-turning anticipation running through their fingertips.";Book
"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book.";Book
I was so excited to finally read The Girl on the Train after hearing a plethora of positive reviews from both friends and critics. I love a good psychological thriller, and I hoped this would be no exception. As soon as I started reading the book I was sucked into the story. I couldn't stop turning pages, and I needed to find out what happened. Unfortunately, I guessed the outcome of the novel right from the beginning, and that really detracted from my enjoyment of the story.The Girl on the Train is the story of Rachel, a twenty-something alcoholic who still loves her ex-husband, despite the fact that he cheated on her and dumped her for the other woman. The book opens with Rachel taking the train every day. She makes up stories about the houses the train goes past on the way, and she loves watching a couple she deems as perfect. One day, the woman in the couple is with another man, and Rachel is quite upset about her cheating. The next day Rachel wakes up a mess after a night of drinking. She has very limited memories of her night, but it turns out the woman she watches from the train is now missing, and she is worried she might be connected to her disappearance in some way.The writing in this book is really well done and quite easy to read, too. I think this is a great novel for those of you who are not big readers, or perhaps you are transitioning from young adult to adult books. While the pacing is generally very quick, I did feel a bit bored during the middle of the book, when I felt like the action slowed down a bit. This is especially true, for me, in hindsight. Because I was able to predict the ending of the book right from the start, it rendered most of the novel moot. I felt like the author walked me around in circles when she could have walked me in a straight line.Nonetheless, I really appreciate the plethora of important issues discussed in The Girl on the Train. For example, Rachel's alcoholism stems from her inability to have children. It makes me so frustrated to think of how women are often deemed worthless if they are unable to have children, even in today's society where we are working so hard to achieve equality between the sexes. I felt so sad for Rachel, and wanted her to get help throughout the book. In fact, I really appreciate that all of the characters in The Girl on the Train are so flawed. I've seen many reviews in which readers criticize the author for writing only terrible characters. Yes, many of the characters in this book do horrible and deplorable things, but I see most of them as having redeemable qualities as well. Other important topics discussed in this book are mental illness, the role of women in society, whether you can really know someone, and when, if ever, can we find truth in life.Overall, The Girl on the Train was a fun read, and I'm glad I picked it up due to its popularity and film adaptation. I am a bit disappointed that the big twist at the end was so predictable, and that is the main reason why I am giving this three out of five stars. That being said, I think The Girl on the Train is the perfect book to read with friends because there are so many topics to be discussed. I will definitely check out any other books that Paula Hawkins writes in the future as well, since I did fly through this one!*This review originally posted on Goodreads;Book
"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I’m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I’m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other’s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she’s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she’s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won’t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I’d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it’s revealed. (Movies, too!) It’s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can’t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I’m reading and frantically turning pages as if they’re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!";Book
"""My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination...""And with that, Rachel the narrator certainly becomes one of the most unreliable narrators I've ever had the pleasure of reading. There are actually several points of view in 'The Girl on the Train' but Rachel is the main narrator. A sad sack of a woman, she has been recently divorced, fired from her job in London and is losing a nasty battle with the bottle. Because she is often drunk, nothing she says or recalls is trustworthy.I needed a break from my usual contemporary romances and this thriller kept me glued to my Kindle! Rachel sees a ""prefect couple"" from the train every day, and she concocts an elaborate fantasy life for them. Surely they must live a perfect life! Unlike her, they seem to live a charmed life, sitting in their pretty garden every day, sipping coffee together.""I don’t know their names, either, so I had to name them myself. Jason, because he’s handsome in a British film star kind of way, not a Depp or a Pitt, but a Firth, or a Jason Isaacs. And Jess just goes with Jason, and it goes with her. It fits her, pretty and carefree as she is. They’re a match, they’re a set. They’re happy, I can tell. They’re what I used to be, they’re Tom and me five years ago. They’re what I lost, they’re everything I want to be.""Slowly we realize that in fact NOTHING in this book is as it seems, and Rachel is soon drawn into a frightening situation about which, sadly for her, she has no memory. On top of everything else, Rachel is constantly morose and sad, depressed about the loss of her beloved husband Tom, and begins to drive everyone away who ever cared about her.""Beautiful sunshine, cloudless skies, no one to play with, nothing to do. Living like this, the way I’m living at the moment, is harder in the summer when there is so much daylight, so little cover of darkness, when everyone is out and about, being flagrantly, aggressively happy. It’s exhausting, and it makes you feel bad if you’re not joining in.""Rachel drinks so much that she begins to black out. She stalks her ex-husband and his new wife Anna but just can't seem to stop herself.""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""This book takes many twists and turns and nothing at all is at it seems. Just when I thought I knew where the story was going, it veered off into another place entirely. it is smart, perfectly paced and filled with flawed, all-too-human characters. Even though Rachel is COMPLETELY unlikable, I was cheering for her throughout the book.'The Girl on the Train' is smart, clever and surprising. Glad I read it before I saw the movie. Highly recommend!!";Book
I admit that I’m no expert when it comes to this genre. In fact, as to date, I have only read three books including this that falls under this category, so I will have to base my review on the general impact of the novel to me to the best of my ability.In my personal opinion, this book passes the mystery-thriller-suspense-crime criteria with flying colors! What makes me say this has a great deal to do with the hypnotic writing style of the author- there is something eerie but magnetic with it and it is a huge mystery to me how the author is able to put across layers of meanings in the simplest thoughts and the most mundane phrases the female characters who are also the narrators utter.It is also noteworthy how the author, in order to craft this forbidding tale, deftly chose these three women who are most flawed and most foolish and yet are unexplainably capable of receiving the reader’s empathy. Of the three POV’s, I was most glued to that of Rachel’s (the major character) whose loneliness seems to magnify her imagination which consequently becomes the core of the plot.It is also quite impressively baffling that the plot seems both linear and rounded at the same time. I felt like nothing happens so much but at the same time, it also felt like everything is happening and unraveling right under my nose and I couldn’t control my heart from hammering against my chest. There were times I had to stop reading and allow the creeps to surface above my skin.;Book
Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone.;Book
pooled ink Reviews:2.5 StarsObviously I was hyped after watching that thrilling movie trailer and decided I would buy the book and read it before I saw the movie. So I did. And now I’m slightly less inclined to see the movie. (But I’ll probably still go because a) Emily Blunt and b) Ooooo it looks crazy!)The book travels up and down the rails following Rachel’s cyclic battle with alcoholism and her obsession with solving Megan’s case as she continues to tangle her life with those linked to Megan, get incredibly drunk, make embarrassing not-great decisions, realizes what she’s done, decides not to drink for half a second and then downs a bottle or two of wine to drown out her embarrassment and misery only to make more poor decisions. It became wearing to read about it for so many pages. Alcoholism is a real problem, I know that, and I also know that I don’t sound very sympathetic, but that’s why I didn’t go to school to become a therapist.The whole book was pretty consistent…and boring. And the killer? It was obvious. I bet you can guess who it was. And the why? It’s pretty easy to guess as well, at least part of it.It’s not a very long book…but it felt long. It felt like the same stuff over and over again. There was nothing exhilarating, surprising, jolting, unnerving. I felt none of it. The only part I enjoyed was the ending of the book when characters starting changing, clues started showing, and all the little lines began meeting to reveal what happened that Saturday night when Megan went missing.All in all this book is filled with sad people with messed up lives making stupid decisions that only work to further ruin their lives. I was tired of reading about it. I just kept waiting for someone to do something worth applauding, but that didn’t come until the very end.Psychological thriller? I think not. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dull commute that only succeeded in making me snooze as I let the gentle rocking of the train lull me into a stupor. Definitely a story better executed as a movie than a book.Read my FULL review here: [...];Book
"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel.";Book
"Books that garner tons of praise frequently make me suspicious and often disappoint.  As my father's fond of saying: ""just because it's a best seller doesn't mean it's a best reader"" and he's right.  So I ignored this NYT best seller for months but saw that it's being made into a movie and decided to give it a shot.  This is indeed a ""Hitchcockian"" thriller that slowly unwinds and leads to an ending that wraps things up but is a bit unsatisfying...maybe because after all the build up I expected more.  Still, this is one of the more engaging books I've read in awhile and it was hard to put down once I got going.  Alcoholic train commuter Rachel likes to watch out the window going to/from the city and enjoys making up a life for a couple she frequently sees outdoors on their terrace.  Then she witnesses what appears to be infidelity and then someone goes missing but Rachel's frequent alcohol fueled blackouts make her unsure of what she's seen and what she truly knows.  Paula Hawkins freshman novel is a winner and I'd definitely read her next effort.";Book
Ok, here's the deal. When a person takes the time and puts in the effort to write a book they automatically get at least 3 stars from me. Now, she is a good writer as far as the technical aspects go and she is fine with the creative elements as well, so I push it to 4 stars. However, I just wasn't terribly moved emotionally or mentally in any new way to give her 5 stars. To get 5 stars you really need to go the distance. You really need to stand out above the crowd with originality and creativity. you really need to move me and to shake me and/or alter my perception or change or challenge my way of thinking or something out of the same old same old, even if I don't like a book for other reasons I can give 5 stars if the author pushes my buttons or gets under my skin. This book does not go the distance. However it is a worthy read in a world of mediocrity that we have today because readers want to be catered to like little babies. Readers are few and lazy today. None of them want to really be challenged. Thus what is ok passes for quality because the lame mainstream readers out there demand to not have their boats rocked except moderately. It is the low intelligence of readers that have given us the minimal fare quality of creativity that is written today.;Book
"I thought this was a bad book. The characters are one-dimensional (you can sum up all of them in one or two words) and the plot was pretty predictable and tedious. The characters do the same thing over and over and the dialogue repeats itself (""you have to stop this""). The way the author uses multiple narrators should provide more depth and intrigue than it actually does, since quite often it turns into each character saying more or less the same thing about the same incident.I know this book is a huge hit and now a movie starring the lovely Emily Blunt. I can't say I really know why. However, I did learn that one can buy gin and tonic in a can in the UK. On some things it really does seem like the Brits have things figured out.";Book
Hummmmmm. So many with the same title. Confusing and all the back many forth from one character to another.  I read it because of the movie....I like the UK setting and have been on the train...... a bit disappointed in this but stayed with it even though I had it figured out.;Book
"If you're looking for one of those mystery novels that leaves you in suspense for the sake of loving the characters, then don't read this. Too often, people pass up good novels or, as seen out here, condemn a good work because the characters are either not relatable or not what they wish they could relate too. Paula Hawkins does a great job in presenting a cast of characters that are flawed and present us with a sense of real life depression. Girl on the Train is often compared to Gillian Flynn's novels like Gone Girl. The difference between the two is that Flynn deliberately presents the reader with characters that are the dregs of society living in the bleakest of circumstances. Hawkins is less severe.With Girl on the Train, you get to know the murderer nearly from the first chapter. She cleverly hands the information to the reader and then equally cleverly expects you to dismiss it. And you will. You get to meet the three graces: Rachel, Anna and Megan. Each presents the story from her point of view. Rachel is the main character who's a seriously disturbed alcoholic with blackouts that start the mystery. Oddly, I found Rachel to be the only character worth knowing and caring about and most of that comes from her confusion as to who she is. You meet Megan next who struggles with sexual boundaries, or more likely borderline personality disorder. She's our lovely victim....and you won't care. Then you meet Anna who has supplanted Rachel in the heart of Tom, former husband, for supposedly being a better choice. Some people have suggested that Anna became pregnant and that's why Tom left Rachel but the timeline doesn't fit. Anna, just happens to be the narcissist who warps reality to fit her needs no matter how ridiculous.So with our three graces come all their flaws, a murder, odd characters hovering on the edges and something not quite right seen through Rachel's eyes. Though condemned for her lack of reliability and serious issues with judgment, Rachel actually does some extraordinary things which made me care. I won't say more other than this is worth reading, if you're a deep person and like to explore the possibility of ""what if this were me?"" If not, don't bother.";Book
I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not.;Book
"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm—his hands, his eyes, his voice—everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".  For a satisfying literary and emotional experience and challenge, I highly recommend this book.";Book
I picked up this book because I saw previews for the movie coming out. With it coming out soon, I burned through the book in a couple of sittings to keep it fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good read for me. The quality of writing is perfectly fine – never felt confused about what the author was trying to convey. The plot leaves a little to be desired. I think my liking of the book is somewhere between “its okay” and “I like it”. My main issues with the story are as follows:1. The book doesn’t really get into the meat of the story until about halfway. I kept waiting for something to happen but it always seemed to be coming eventually.2. The book is only told from the POV of the women – Rachel, Megan, and Anna. Tom, Scott, and to a lesser extent Megan’s shrink, do not get a chapter to themselves. I assume this is done because if they had, there would be no mystery. I’m not sure if this is lazy writing, but it certainly makes the narrative a little biased.3. The author spends the entire book basically saying that the killer can’t possibly be a certain character and then at the end of the book – SURPRISE! – it is. That is not really a twist by my definition.4. When you do find out who the killer is, everything wraps up in the last 20 pages and the story is over. I wasn’t expecting any sort of slasher killer fake ending with the murderer constantly popping up, but after the reveal the book just rockets to the end and doesn’t let anything sink in for the reader.Despite the issues I had, I still enjoyed reading the book and would recommend it. It is interesting to read from Rachel’s POV because you can see her mind unravel at times and you can’t trust some things she says. Give it a read, or maybe just check out the movie, but don’t expect it to change your life.;Book
I have mixed feelings about this book. It was good, but it wasn't quite as good as I expected based on all the hype. The writing style was pretty straight forward and simple. In many people's opinion, simple writing is better and it certainly stayed away from the purple prose. So it points for that. Still it wasn't beautifully written. The story was told from the viewpoint of three female characters and it is a murder mystery sort of novel. Much of the book deals with characters reflecting back while not being able to piece together who committed the murder. The book isn't very long and is a book that someone can read fairly quickly. I like books that I can read in a night, so this is a plus to me. At times it felt like the book was dragging though as it kind of left us wondering without much movement in the plot. Since the main event already happened, there was a lot of /waiting to find out/ about the storyline. The main character (the girl on the train) was a decent character.  Rachel is an alcoholic with blackouts, an inability to have children and at her core a heart of gold. The story was also written from the viewpoint of Anna, the more slender, more beautiful and more fertile girl who hooked up with Rachel's husband while they were still married and later married him herself. Anna is sort of the typical /bitchy other woman/ who eventually admits that didn't really care that she taking a married man. The story was also told from the viewpoint of a the pretty blonde Megan who cheats on her husband and has a troubled past. The female characters were interesting. The book goes into the nature of a manipulative relationships and could be a helpful read to woman who have gone through domestic violence or tend to fall for bad guys.;Book
"I had added ""Girl On a Train"" to my summer reading list, and was anxious to start it.  It was high on my list - right after Orphan Train and All the Light We Cannot See. I had no preconceived ideas about it and did not know the story line. Given the number of great reviews, I was pretty shocked when I was halfway through it and simply not engaged. I could have put it down and not returned to it. I get the theme of ""these-characters-aren't-who-you-think-they-are"", but how many chapters of the main character's obsessive screw ups, alcoholism, mental instability,  and self-loathing do we need to witness before thinking the author doubts our comprehension and needs to repeat it for us?For awhile, the most interesting part for me was the momentary supposition that Megan and Rachel were the same person due to MPD - at the same time knowing the impossibility of that considering the cross-over of people in both their lives. By the time the author fleshed out Meghan's background issues - I just didn't care. It had taken too long and I just didn't care to pick up the [new] baggage of Meghan's self-loathing after spending half the book watching Rachel embrace her pathetic-ness.I don't know if one would consider it a ""disclaimer"" but I have a degree in Criminology, so I may be more pragmatic in my attitude. I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and feel I am easily engaged and don't tend to over criticize.With that said, (and trying to avoid spoilers) - I thought the perpetrator was obvious early on, based on actions and history......not conversation and pretenses.  And come on - the ""nanny scenario??""  Seriously""Normally, in a thriller or mystery I really like - the characters are woven with a complexity that involves me. Later on, it should be a surprise regarding who they really are. Quite simply - I didn't want to know any of these people.";Book
"Whenever each of us reads a book, consciously - or unconsciously -  our reactions to the story, the characters, the writing  all affected by what we  to the story. My own reading experience was quite disturbing, so much so that the psychological, emotional abuse of my past marriage was triggered in ways that stunned and frightened me.  Proust was either lucky or fanciful with the charming memories triggered by his famous madeleine cookies.  This novel is suspenseful and fast paced.  It is also a subtle and complex story about women -  women's experiences and desires within the context of Western culture: how women live with men - or ,in this story, a man - about how we come to believe ""truths"" about ourselves.  The story can be read in many ways: suspenseful murder mystery; fast paced psychological mystery; and also as a story about a complex main character -  weak  and unlikeable when first introduced - and her relationships within the other women's stories.  As this tale is unwoven by the author, we find the main character caught up in a plausible tale about the fallout from lies and the (too often invisible) psychological and emotional abuse women endure silently, frequently without self-awareness, leaving these characters with few skills to ""see"" the truth.  Highly recommend.";Book
It's been a long time since I've been able to finish a book because the author seems to lose me in the middle--if not at the beginning. This one though, kept me hooked til the end! Can't wait to see the movie, by I can't imagine it topping the book.;Book
This is my first read from this author. It was an awesome book! The story kept me in suspense until the very last page. It was completely unpredictable. Can't wait to see the movie coming out Oct 7th!;Book
Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness.;Book
I was very disappointed. I read the reviews and thought from the ratings this was a safe bet. After completing the long and dreary story I felt the reviewers who believed this to be a great thriller really haven't read one. Sorry, but this story did nothing for me except wear me out. Very repetitive...;Book
"Knock off of, ""Gone Girl,"" except not as good. The description of the book sounded so good! And it got such great reviews. The book was written okay, however I couldn't invest myself in the characters and was often confused as I often felt like I missed something because information was left out. The main character isn't likeable which made the book even worse. Waste of time.";Book
"This book proved to be aggravating, confusing, and frustrating, but also riveting, enjoyable, suspenseful, and enticing; well worth the time and effort. I recommend this highly. It is a book that requires you to question everything. It kept me guessing for a long time.";Book
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. The story is engaging and the writing is excellent taking the reader on a train ride to an exciting and thrilling conclusion leaving the reader will a hopeful outlook for Rachel and Anna.;Book
I tried to read it twice. It was not enjoyable. Frustrating, couldn't follow her. I wonder if the girl had dual personalities. maybe.;Book
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so;Book
"AMAZING read! I was looking for a good ""grabber"" book - one that you start reading and it pulls you in - and I found it with the Girl on the Train! I think of this as a combo of Gone Girl and The Husband's Secret. Both great reads, adding this one to my recommendation list.";Book
Very poorly written, confusing, and literally a waste of my time.  Difficult to distinguish individual characters in the story.  So bad that I continued to read in hopes that it had to improve .... did not.;Book
Couldn't put it down, however I was hoping for something a little more compelling toward the end. The fact that all three women were somewhat submissive and weak made me feel some sort of way.;Book
After seeing over 50,000 good reviews, I thought I would love this book. I didn't. I read a lot of books and I give out a lot of recommendations. I do not recommend this one.;Book
Took this book on vacation, and couldn't put it down until I finished it. Seldom does one get a mystery / thriller with action on every page, with engaging dialog on the non-physical chapters. Loved the book!;Book
"""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent read! I love it when I don't see the twists coming, and this novel is full consists of twists and a totally unexpected ending! If you're a fan of ""Gone Girl"" you will love this novel!";Book
"Rachel Watson lives a sad life. Her marriage fell apart, she drinks, and fantasized about a ""perfect couple"" she sees on her train ride. But this couple is not perfect as she thought. If you love, Gone Girl, you will enjoy the twist in this book.";Book
As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it.;Book
This was a great story though some parts are hard to read. The construction of the story keeps things interesting and makes for a quick read.  Good characters and a good twist at the end.;Book
Clearly a great read. Looking for something that resembles another book? Gone Girl? I would recommend this to the Gone Girl fan or anyone that wants to have a treat for the eyes to read..!;Book
All the hype on this book this year that perhaps that created my disappointment. Though good and finally half way thru it did grab my interest. Yet still a let down.;Book
More about girl talk and alcohol and less about suspense! It became boring and I lost interest. It was easy to know who killed Megan.;Book
This book was just the right combination of thrilling and reality.  I loved the sub plots of the characters as the narration shifted.  The characters are relatable and the story moves at a nice place.  I will be reading more by this author.;Book
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.;Book
It was a bit short and too fast. But the suspense was well worth it!  I found the characters well narrated during their own POV as well, the surroundings descriptive.;Book
Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent.;Book
It was an engaging read.  Not fabulous in terms of literary ability or even plot, but it kept me reading until the end.;Book
I see a lot of bad reviews but I don't know why, this was a great book! I decided i would read the book before watching the movie and I'm glad I did. The book was WAY better! This is a real page turner, I could have read it in one day if I wasn't so busy!;Book
I love a good mystery. I really can't remember one like this of all the hundreds I've read that used alcohol and alcoholism in this way. I thought the merger of this and also the conflicting  relationships secrets people hide and also find out about people they never suspected was very intriguing. I did guess correctly but did have my doubts and second guessed myself due to the creative writing and the excellent drama created. I would highly recommend this book. I also listened to a portion of it and loved the main character's narrator. The other one was good for that person, as well. But I am so glad she wasn't the main reader and was that way for a reason because when people talk like that for a whole story I just start to feel extremely awful. As in bored and anxiously so.The subject of domestic abusive was dealt with relatively well. Some really enlightening segments, which is always good.;Book
Actually liked the movie better.  I think movie did a better job of explaining how rachel didn't remember the past because of all the lies she was told.;Book
Absolutely captivates the reader into the story, submerged in intense emotional angst of multiple characters which initially seems entwined only within the imagination of a single soul.  Absolute must read.;Book
I'm not understanding why this is getting such high reviews, let alone made into a movie - a train wreck of a book, where is the editing?  It starts off okay but towards the middle there's so much repetition that a good 50+ pages could have been cut out that would have improved the story.  The girl on the train, Rachel, is an alcoholic and watches a couple on her commute who live on the same street she previously did with her ex husband.  When the woman in the couple goes missing she tries to figure out what happened, and if she was nearby that night due to her continued stalking of her ex hubby.  We get repeated mentions of:- let's call my hubby to help me remember (3-4 times), or just showing up on the street multiple times- going to the underpass beneath the train tracks (3x or so)- trying to find another commuter who interacted with her that night (3-4 times)- trying to contact the husband of the missing women, stalking him tooIt improves toward the end, when we finally don't have the repeated chapters over and over again. The characters were all unlikable, with Rachel being one of the most annoying ever created - found myself almost wishing something would happen to her.;Book
Based on the numerous positive reviews, I was all ready to thoroughly enjoy this book.  The reviews imply plot-twists and edge-of-your-seat reading.  However, I found myself continuing to read for one simple reason:  I was waiting for the big twist or turn or to be completely thrown.  It never came.  I surmised the major plot twist about 1/3 of the way through the book, but kept thinking I might be missing something.  I wasn't.  As other reviewers have stated, the characters are mildly likeable but tend to border more on the annoying.  Their lives, as described by the three various narrators, were uninteresting.  There were many parts of the narrations that could have gone in a compelling direction and would draw you in, but those tangents were often simple, short and left you feeling as if the book was written simple to get to the end.  It was an okay read - definitely a sit by the beach to read the mundane type of book.;Book
"Interesting premise, decent execution. A refreshing change to have 3 main female protagonists who all have warts (although nothing in comparison to the males). The ""multiple viewpoint first person"" narrative (I'm sure there's a more technical literary name for this) is an interesting conceit but a bit confusing at first. In my view, the  story could have been told just as effectively by only two of the 3 narrators. Also one thing that gets missed in this format is any broader descriptive detail and explicit point of view on the evolution of modern British suburban society that lends itself to the rise of twits like these people (since only one of the 3 female narrators --and none of their 2 dimensional male counterparts--will admit to being twits as part of their narrative)The story itself could actually take place anywhere; needn't have been the Home Counties in the UK. However, compared to the mindlessness of the post-yuppie suburban twits we have in the US, these UK versions are pretty soft-edged, maybe even tolerable neighbors. Maybe I'll emigrate.The intersection of the personal narrative of the ""main"" protagonist and the mystery she's drawn into means there are inevitable missed turns on the plot roadmap. At one point I was flipping back through earlier pages thinking I'd either missed something or had inherited the heroine's propensity for drunken blackouts. Had this been a movie we would've commented ""hmmm, guess the last half of THAT plot line ended up on the cutting room floor.""All that aside, this was a decent read and a good diversion. I look forward to reading her next effort. also look forward to what I assume will be the inevitable film version of ""girl on a train"", which I think could actually rectify some of the plotting and narrative blind spots of the book. ) This book is being marketed as ""the next Gone Girl"", but in the right hands, I think a film version of this book could be so much stronger than Gone girl, which I thought had all the predictability of ritual Kabuki theater but with a suspenseful soundtrack.";Book
I was looking for another great thriller after loving Gone Girl, and since this was just released as a feature film I wanted to read the book before I see the movie. Unfortunately I did not feel that it lived up the hype. Not a single one of the characters is very likeable, so it's hard to care about what about happens to them, or feel invested in the story. For a split second (about 3/4 of the way through the book), it got interesting and the mystery started to feel intriguing, but after all the build-up the final few chapters flew by fairly predictably.There is a lot of flipping back and forth between the characters telling the story, which was kind of similar to Gone Girl, but each section is written in the same style so it doesn't really seem like you're reading another person's perspective. And each section is dated, again copied from Gone Girl, but many of them are out of sequence so I found myself flipping back several times to figure out the timeline.All in all, it was just okay. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. And I don't have much of a desire to see the movie anymore.;Book
"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book.  It is ""very British"" meaning not an American voice, references that resonate with UK citizens made me look up words.Perhaps the fact that I am American, pragmatically American, I did not connect with any of the characters. Not even the baby was described in a way that made me smile; whining, grizzing, no cooing or cuddles really.The characters are self involved and yet not evolved as human beings, which, I suppose is usually the case.The mystery is very good.  It is a true twisting tale of human craziness.  Maybe like the classic Of Human Bondage.Upon reading the last page, I felt sad, not hopeful. I don't think that the character arc was complete but as this is a mystery,perhaps it is keeping in its kind.The other thing that I thought was,""this author is messed up."". But I am middle aged, not raised in the cable tv extremes that millennials, etc have been inured to since birth.  The way that it s written is new, the myriads of relationships:ancient.This book is timeless and brutal, perhaps in the end, there is hope.";Book
I read this book with my book club. I was intrigued by the promise of unreliable narrators, because they are a weakness of mine. If you don't care for those, or feel cheated or lied to when you read that sort of thing, you'll want to skip this one. I was also interested by people comparing the author to Gillian Flynn. There are definite similarities. I think if you like one,  you'll like the other.I suppose this book would be considered a psychological thriller, Or a murder mystery, but I'm not very good at identifying the right categories for these things. I do recall, after years of watching shows like Bones and Monk, that you can identify the killer by spotting the unnecessary character. In those TV shows, that always works. In this book, I thought I had done that, but it turned out I was wrong. And I was pleased by the red herring. Again, unreliable narrators make that difficult to find. So, don't expect this to be easy to figure out right away.The story is very dark. I think it manages to be less dark than Gillian Flynn's books, but not by much. There are three narrators. Rachel is who I would consider to be the main character. She is a divorcee with a drinking problem, prone to drunken blackouts, unable to remember what happens during them. She's also one of the only likable characters in the book. With all of her flaws she still manages to be sympathetic. It can be hard for the reader not to root for her, even while cringing at a lot of her choices.The book was engaging from the very beginning, with the story drawing you in and keeping you there, because you'll want to know what happens next. I highly recommend it.  Thoughts of a nerdy feminist read;Book
I have to say that it was a wonderful book. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. I didn't try to think ahead I just went with the flow as I believe the author wished for me. People in reviews said the were confused but that shouldn't have been necessary. After a few pages you get them etched in your mind so vividly. I am 70 so my memory really isn't that good, so at first I wrote the characters names down and a bit of a description of them. I referred to it after I was forced to put my book down and do some dang work. I would quickly review my notes and just like that I was back into my story. ( I. Loved. Every. Moment. Of. This. Book.)  Any resemblance to Gone Girl is silly. That book had a stupid ending.  I don't have a single complaint about the story. I do have a complaint about the people here telling too many details about the story. I stayed away on purpose because I knew they would ruin the story for me.Paula, you wrote a fabulous story and it was way more satisfying than Gone Girl could have hoped to have been. I will miss the thrill of having this book to read.................what am I going to do with myself. Any book I pick up will pale in comparison!!;Book
"It’s hard to be objective about a novel that strives so determinedly (and successfully) to make its characters as unlikable as those in Paula Hawkins’ bestselling mystery, “The Girl On the Train”. With not one, but three, unreliable narrators jumping back and forth in time offering first-person perspectives on unfolding events, the book chronicles the intertwined stories of sad-sack drunkard, Rachel, the titular girl on the train; Megan, the secretive blonde half of a seemingly perfect couple Rachel spies on from the train; and Anna, a hard-edged suburbanite who envisions herself as the perfect wife and mother.The central mystery begins when one of the women goes missing.The main narrative, necessarily, comes from Rachel, still wallowing in booze and self-pity years after her husband left her for the younger, prettier Anna. In fact, Anna, the usurper, and Rachel’s ex-husband are still living in the same house that once belonged to Rachel. Having lost her job due to drunkenness, Rachel still takes the train each day from the suburbs into London, not only to make her sober-minded roommate think she’s still gainfully employed, but also to keep an eye on her ex and the woman occupying her old home; the train just happens to pass right by the place. A few doors down lives a beautiful young couple whom Rachel also watches, becoming a little too fascinated by their lives lived largely out in the back yard and through open windows. Although Rachel nicknames them Jess and Jason and envies what she perceives to be their idyllic wedded bliss, it soon becomes apparent that appearances are deceiving, especially after she witnesses a shocking act that shakes up her vicarious fantasy life. But, did she, in fact, see what she thought she saw? Rachel’s reality is blurred from heavy drinking which often results in blackouts; her problems are compounded by her stalking of not only her ex-husband, Tom, and his increasingly agitated wife, but of Scott and Megan, the real-life “lovebirds” Rachel knows as Jess and Jason. What follows is a harrowing, sometimes confusing yarn that allows for no “good guys” and sees Rachel making one misstep after another after another until finally, I lost patience with her to the point that I found it difficult to finish the book. A main character doesn’t necessarily have to be likable, or even relatable, to maintain a good story but they should offer up something—sympathy, grudging admiration, even hatred—to keep the reader hooked in to that character, to want to know what happens to him or her. Rachel used up what sympathy I had for her very quickly, and while I didn’t like her at all, I didn’t dislike her enough by the end to care what happened to her. By the time she finally rallies from her downtrodden hangdog state, it was too little, too late; I simply didn’t care. However, being very familiar with the behavior of alcoholics, I did find Rachel’s behavior to be believable (for the most part), if tiring.The character of Megan was more interesting, and perhaps, more sympathetic. With dark secrets in both her past and present, Megan is a well-structured character who is damaged and self-destructive, not a nice woman but not someone who is intentionally cruel. Her own missteps, more dramatic than Rachel’s (at least early on), are poignant and truly heartbreaking, and while the character of Rachel is the protagonist of the story, it is Megan who really drives it.Anna, the third voice in “Girl On the Train”, is probably the least developed of the three narrators. Presented as a vain, calculating homewrecker whose deeds are doubling back on her, Anna is something of a narcissist, who is, understandably, at the end of her rope with Rachel and her attendant drama. Anna considers herself to be clear-headed and sane compared to the other female characters in the novel, although her narcissism precludes her from seeing that she’s as deluded as they are.The problem I found with having three narrators is that their voices begin to seem strangely similar as one chapter featuring Anna flows into the next chapter, narrated by Rachel, and so on. If Rachel isn’t on a drunken binge, it’s difficult to separate her musings from those of Anna; in more than one instance, I found myself thumbing back to the beginning of a chapter to see if it was titled “Rachel”, “Anna” or “Megan”.The men in the story are also difficult to separate in some instances, and even more sketchily written than Anna. Tom, Anna’s husband and Rachel’s ex, is very much like Scott, Megan’s husband, and neither seems to be all that distinctive. There’s also a shady psychiatrist on hand who doesn’t seem to balk at bedding his patients, and a couple of cops who never come to life, existing merely as words on a page. Of course, they’re an awkward necessity in moving the story forward (and in offending Rachel).Also awkward is the fact that characters narrate events in the present, often simultaneously with a different character in the following chapter, while another character narrates events from months, or years, earlier. Again, it’s a necessity in moving the story forward (and in tying up all the loose ends) but it feels awkward. The solution to the mystery, when it comes, isn’t surprising but it is serviceable and doesn’t insult the reader’s intelligence.As trying as I often felt “The Girl On the Train” to be, it does offer up some suspense, and isn’t altogether horrible. Paula Hawkins writes well and I hope she’ll up her game on her next literary outing.";Book
"Maybe it's because I've read so many books of this type, but I found the story to be predictable, and the ending was not a surprise for me.Additionally, I did not find the characters to be all that likable.  Rachael comes across as a sloth.  Megan reads as a self-centered, conniving, bish, although she has a revelation of such profound and utter sadness that my heart sank to the pit of my stomach for several hours (getting into a book brings the characters alive for me; they are temporarily people that 'I know').  Anna both revels in gloating satisfaction and plays the weak victim at the same time.  Cathy is a roommate with a level of patience that doesn't seem believable.  Tom and Scott, even when they aren't doing anything 'wrong', both seem like condescending jerks to me.I feel like I am 'supposed' to like this book, because someone liked it well enough to turn it into a major motion picture, but I can't quite give it a glowing review.I will say that the author did a decent job of keeping the twists and turns easy enough to follow.  The story was 'okay'.  I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stand out as a read above the rest.";Book
"The reader becomes a voyeur into the life of a voyeur. The characters in this book are definitely out of the norm (I hope), each with some serious problems and some extreme behaviors. There is an air of mystery as I was almost reluctantly drawn into the story, wanting to know more about these creepy people and to learn what had actually happened to them, as the story unfolds from different perspectives. It would be impossible to lump any character into a category of either ""good"" or ""bad,"" as (with all humans) each is a complex combination of both. All seem to be in need of a trusted friend,partner and/or counselor. But wait! These needs are being met by those types of people throughout the book - or are they? Is anyone truly worthy of trust? (Note: The sex and violence is not explicit.)";Book
Really having a hard time getting into,this!!! I usually canjumpy around in books ...not this for some reasonDid not see movie yet;Book
How boring and cliche. These days, the hand that rocks the publishing cradle is the extra money in the bank just about anyone who is on the bestseller list has to drink coffee at bourgeois cafes whilst waiting for heir manuscript to be picked up and published. Barf.;Book
I usually read thrillers , suspense, fast-paced who done-it's. Even though this was different somehow, it was still a great read. A page-turner. Love the style this book was written. Anxiously look forward to the next!;Book
So many twists and turns it's hard to keep them straight. None of the characters in this book are particularly likeable or sympathetic but I could not put it down.;Book
I had high hopes for this book, however I was very disappointed with the way characters developed and how some parts of the book that were made to seem important were never brought back up. I would not recommend.;Book
I read the bulk of this book in one day, because I couldn't put it down.I had known beforehand, from reading other people's reviews, that all of the characters were going to be loathsome and unreliable-- This is true and still, I think it adds to the story. You never know who to trust and you have to take each character's story with a grain of salt. For me that made the mystery more fun, like I was a third detective in the novel trying to figure out the puzzle.I guessed who the killer was about 2/3's of the way through the book but feeling like I had solved the case didn't ruin the unfolding of the rest of the story for me. There was still enough doubt in the back of my mind that took me through to the end.This was a fast-paced read that had a lot of twists and turns. I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more mysteries like this in the future.;Book
A really good Psychological thriller. About an alcoholic that thinks she knows what happens to a married woman that comes up missing. But, she was drunk and can't be sure. Hawkins does a great job of weaving in each of the main characters to the story.An ex-husband his new wife and child, another married man who's wife comes up missing and that the main character thinks she may have feeling for him. And this kind, gentle and mysterious Doctor. The one the missing wife is seeing. So what happen? where is she? and who did it?;Book
This read was not the type of book I usually read. It was exciting near the end. A little slow in the beginning. It did keep you guessing.;Book
Enjoyed reading this book.  Lots of interesting characters and unexpected turns.  I can't wait for the movie to come out and see how it plays out on screen.;Book
"Reading the ""girl on the train"" was intriguing to say the least, seeing someone go through life believing that they are no good until they found out things were not what they seem to be. Now take Rachel for instant, going around letting everyone think she had a job, traveling on a train every single day, just to keep herself amused not sure; however she got herself into something that led to her finding out the man she married was pure evil and would go as far as killing someone to keep his secret. This was a good thriller to say the least, pretty good read.";Book
The novel pulled me into its sinister plot by the second chapter.  It twisted and turned and then twisted again, finally spitting me out at the end.  A most enjoyable read.;Book
Enjoyed the book and I plan on watching the movie. Books are usually better than the movies by far hope I'm not disappointed.;Book
What an unfolding... Gripping, turning, a master story telling. You will not be able to put it down! Incredibly powerful;Book
I just finished it...Want a book you can't put down? Read This!!!I have not had a great book to read in a long time.;Book
heard this book was good so I'm giving it a good review , I just started reading it and so fat it has a good story line .;Book
Really enjoyed this book.  Hard to put down .  Rich characters.  Suspenseful.  Kept me guessing for two thirds of the book and still had doubt till the final reveal.  If you like Gone Girl, give this a try.;Book
The story around the main character is rather despairing at times even though she becomes the heroine in the end. Did not keep the book in my library after reading. Gave it away to the library.;Book
I found myself wanting to be able to put things aside in order to get back to reading this book. I wanted to know more about the characters, and found myself suspecting each one in turn. I didn't want to put this one down.;Book
Great book with well developed characters. I wish there was one male that could have been a role model.  It's almost like the person who wrote it sees all men as cruel and uncaring of women.;Book
What a great read! I couldn't put it down, didn't want to! So many twists and turns with quite a surprise ending! A wonderful murder mystery!!!;Book
I did not go and see the movie because I  wanted to read the book and I 'my glad I did.  There is nothing like the images of the characters and the settings in your own mind to carry you through the story.  Despite  knowing that Emily Blount played the lead, I  was able to image Rachel in another way.  And, unfortunately, in my opinion, despite Ms. Blount being very attractive, I don't  believe from what I saw from the trailer, she could have accurately portrayed Rachel totally.  However, what I enjoyed about this author's style is that she captured what I feel  is essential to writing mysteries:  make every word and story element count!!  The reader wants to collect information about people, places and things.  We don't like unnecessary story angles that go on and on or ridiculous love stories that have no bearing on the case.  The odd red herring or sexual tension here or there is fine, but be about the story or we lose interest and on to the bookshelf or to the yard sale you go.;Book
I was so disappointed in this book;Book
I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!;Book
This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The movie makers had to introduce another whole character to explain the plot in this book. I can't believe it was on the NY Times Best Seller list.  That doesn't say much for the NY Times.;Book
predictable plot, I accurately selected the killer while only 50% through the book. Waited to maybe be surprised or be proven wrong - nope :( ..... everything as I suspected. Not very mind stimulating mystery story. If you have nothing to read at the moment go for it, but have very low expectations. Because of simple scenario and easy to read characters I do not see how they will make a good movie out of it.;Book
This is the story of three awful women.  If they formed a support group and if support groups had mottoes, I suggest that theirs would be “I needed this, so I gave myself permission to take it.”  And what do awful women end up with if not awful husbands and boyfriends?This novel is in epistolary form, except that chapters are in the form of morning and evening diary entries instead of letters.  In addition, the chapters aren’t in chronological order.  So one woman’s narrative is followed in the next chapter by another woman’s narrative from a year earlier.  It was a little confusing at first, but it wasn’t hard to get the hang of it.Rachel, the protagonist, is the most well-developed and interesting character.  In addition, the scenes are sketchy.  But in every other respect, what the writer does for the beginning two-thirds of the book, exhibits a mastery of detail and pacing, particularly in Rachel’s narrative as she makes her way in these urban and suburban settings.  These chapters have fine literary qualities, enticing the reader to continue.However, the writer doesn't smoothly integrate this literary first part of the novel with the overall detective mystery orientation.  The last third of the book (the “caboose”, let’s say) becomes a regular mystery story, written in more of a mass-market paperback style, but the first part makes it all worthwhile.As we gradually discover more and more about Rachel, some readers might find it depressing.  Without giving too much away, here’s something to help you hang in there.  Rachel’s second worst vice, her lack of respect for boundaries, is what keeps her from succumbing to her worst and most deadly vice.This is not a good gift for the younger kids.  There’s cursing, gruesome violence andheavy drinking.2.88 stars;Book
I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting...;Book
"I'm not certain why this book has been compared to Gone, Girl.  To me, it was written very differently and outside of a woman being missing and the husband being a suspect, they weren't anything alike in my opinion.This book was picked by my book club and I had a hard time finishing it.  My problem was that I disliked each and every character, but especially the main character, Rachel.  She is a person who makes the same decisions to drink, black out, then wakes up confused but knowing she's ""done something bad"".  She phones her ex husband on a regular basis, drunk, crying and/or  harassing he and his wife; she sponges off her roommate who for some reason puts up with her drinking and passing out constantly.  Rachel goes through a repetitious cycle of drinking, blacking out and waking up knowing she has ""done something bad"".  The thing is, she makes the same decisions over and over.  I wanted to personally slap her midway through the story and thereafter.  I nearly stopped reading it several times.I could barely get through this book and the only reason I finished it was to find out what actually happened to the missing woman.  Other than that, save your money and get it from the library if you can take reading about characters who are the weakest people you'll ever meet.";Book
"I wish I liked this one more. It is an interesting concept with the alternating chapters between characters, the vague narration, the mystery of a woman's disappearance, the train travel. But for me the good parts did not outweigh the boring or less than stellar parts.My feelings in short: Engaging beginning, boring middle, exciting ending.My main problems were:1. Writing style. It was waaaaaaay too much internal dialogue. Some is totally okay. We all think in our heads or talk to ourselves. But I hate excessive internal dialogue, and in the case of this story it was a lot. So for me, this was a major issue. Now, if you like internal dialogue, you may very well love this book. But I personally need more character interactions; more showing, less telling, please.2. Characters. I also didn't like any of these characters, except for Rachel's roommate (who was dismissed for being nice). Rachel, Anna, and Megan are the narrators, and I found my interest in them waning. Having an alcoholic for a main narrator was interesting to start, then super annoying. Tom and Scott were no better. These people all had issues galore, which usually makes for an intriguing read. But unfortunately, even with their issues, I lost my interest in them.3. Repetitive. I was pretty engaged in the first 30% or so. Basically until I figured out the twist. Then I was waiting for the characters to catch up with me. Then I was bored. It was lie, get drunk, blackout; rinse and repeat. Once I knew what was coming (maybe not the details, but the main idea), I felt like maybe 100 pages of the book could have been removed due to sheer repetitiveness, and it would have been fine with me. Living in an alcoholic haze with Rachel became tedious. The saving grace was the ending. At least it left me on a high note.On the positive side, I read this book for my book club, and I was in the minority on my feelings toward it. The other women either liked or loved it. So this book got a 5/6 approval rating from us. No one else in my book club figured out the twist, either, so they were far more engaged than I was. Perhaps if I hadn't figured out the twist at 30% I would have liked it more, too. Oh well.Would I recommend this book? Sure. If you like a book with mystery and odd characters, and don't mind a lot of internal dialogue, this might just be the book for you.";Book
This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever read.  It lacks depth, has an under developed plot and characters, is confusing, jumps all over the place, and resembles something that an under performing 7th grader would write.  How it remains on the best seller continues to amaze me.  Very poorly written, a total waste of time to read, (but trust me, it will not take much of your time to read.)  I certainly hope America's interest is such a dime store calamity is not a reflection on the education of the American public.  Take a pass on this one.I've rated it one star which is one star more than it deserves.;Book
This book was good.  Not great. Hard to follow the dates and voices at times.  I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.;Book
Like a UK Gone Girl. Only different.A valid example of why we shouldn't booze it up.And perhaps a bit of why we should.;Book
"Had read a review in a magazine and was looking forward to reading it.  Very suspenseful and reminiscent of ""Gone Girl""  I have recommended it to friends.";Book
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring;Book
Excellent thriller. Unexpected final. One of the best books I have ever read. An amazing narrative...I felt every single moment. A must read book...!!!;Book
I recommend this book the story is unique, gripping and a page turner thriller. Interesting  characters. Life is about perception....the things you imagine and reality. Good read! Go for it.;Book
Slow moving depressing story, but interesting non the less. Glad they didn't sugar coat the ending.;Book
I heard the book was as good as Gone Girl,which I read and saw the movie.This book did not disappoint and I look forward to the movie.;Book
Interesting character and development of them. Sometimes a little to much depth going back into the past.  Figured out some parts along the way. Glad I read prior to seeing the movie;Book
I have missed to reading a book that was so intriguing that forced to keep reading. Very well written and incredibly thrilling. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. Great thriller book!;Book
The Girl on the Train is a perfect primer for women who still believe the man they fall in love with is responsible for their happily ever after. The story is narrated by three women--Rachel, wife #1, Anna, wife # 2, and Megan, the new prospect. All are involved with one man, Tom, in an overlapping sequence of events. It so happens that Tom is perfect for all three of the women at the beginning of each relationship because he is masterful at giving each what they need. Therefore, each woman fails to see that Tom becomes manipulative and controlling. But as each relationship falters, all three women expect Tom to make it better. Unfortunately for them, Tom's idea of improving a bad relationship is to move on to a new one--which becomes a problem that hits Tom squarely when Megan, the new woman he is involved with, decides to no longer be manipulated. When she threatens to take control from him, life as each woman knew it spirals out of control.This novel is a worthy read because it shows how easy it is for some women to willingly give up control of their happiness to the man who promises them love forever. In the case of the women in this story, their unhappiness involves so much whining and drinking that it's hard to like any of them. However, Rachel does redeem herself when she starts to realize Tom has manipulated her to a level that shows he is dangerous and capable of much worse. Tom is the anatomy of a perfect psychopath, and the author leaves enough unsaid about Tom until the reader puts it all together. This book is a must for women who still believe in the fairy tale prince!;Book
I read this book without reading any reviews, because there is always some (selfish) person who gives away too much of the story, or who (selfishly) shares the ending.  So I went in not knowing how the story was narrated or how the dates changed.  This is how I would recommend reading this book.I loved it!Yes, the characters can be frustrating, but I loved how each character stood on their own........until they didn't. I loved how the characters were developed little by little, especially Rachel.  I will say, it took me a few pages to decide I liked the book, but once I got into it, I had a hard time putting it down.  I found I was reading quickly because I needed to see what happened, but then I was going back and re-reading to fully take it all in.  I don't use the Highlight feature on my kindle much, but I used it a lot in this story.When it all starts to come together, when you start to see the time-line connections, when you start to feel like the ending is right around the corner.........it's not, and I loved that!  I am one of those people who watches too many crime dramas and the who-done-it is rarely a surprise, but this book kept me turning the page until all was revealed.  My only complaint about this book might be the somewhat quick wrap-up on the final two or three pages.  I wanted to know more, I wanted to know what happens to them all now.  I didn't want the book to be over.;Book
"Initially I liked this story, but by the end I was frustrated by it.I liked that the main character had built a story around people she sees through the train window and that those stories seem real to her. I like that she comes to realize how off-base her interpretation is. I also liked that she is an unreliable narrator trying to fill in her own story gaps.I was frustrated by several things. First, the chapters alternate between different characters (a style that I am tiring of in novels), but they are also different timelines. Often the chapters were a bit longer, so I didn't always finish my reading section at the end/beginning of a chapter, and when I returned to the story I didn't necessarily remember whose chapter/timeline I was in. And because I was reading on a Kindle, I sometimes had to click-click-click through pages to find that information from the beginning of the chapter (because it wasn't always readily apparent by context).Second, there was a certain point in the novel where the clues culminated in ""whodunit,"" but the character was slow to catch on after that point which I found frustrating.Finally, the ending fell flat to me. The story as a whole seemed to be written in a particular style, but the final scenes were reminiscent of a typical murder/suspense formula.About 2/3 of the way through, I just wanted to get to the end to see how it turned out. Hence, the lower rating.Do I consider it a waste of my time? No, certainly not. Just didn't leave me thinking ""wow.""";Book
The book is extremely well written. The machinations inside the minds of the characters are fascinating.The deep philological twists and currents of  addiction are splayed open for the reader to view with startling honesty. This book is a deep look inside the mind of tortured soul, all wrapped up in a fairly complex mystery. Now for why I took off a star: Without spoiling the plot, I will list 3 reasons: Remember the heroine from the old films who decides she just has to go alone into the dark basement forbidden hidden room on a stormy night... with the power out... with no protection... hearing strange noises...after being threatened...barefoot...in nightgown... Now, imagine the heroine does this over and over again. Really? The book starts off with at a really slow pace and the train only picks up a little speed in the last few chapters.The angst and agony of the tortured soul becomes whining and weak when the 'victim' is caught in a cycle of self destruction. Wash, rinse, repeat. I left my review at 4 stars instead of dropping to 3 was due to the wonderful writing ability of the author, a good mystery, and the half cup of hope tossed into the rinse cycle.;Book
I read this, mostly, on a plane from Manila to London. I then went on a non-stop bus trip from London to Bath and found the lady in front of me also reading it.  This would seem to indicate that it is an easy read, which it is. Each chapter is devoted to a particular date over a three year period, switching between characters. I read the Kindle version and found it hard to keep track of the dates, although this is a deficiency in the Reader rather than in the Author.  I would have preferred to read the hard copy version for this reason. The story moves smoothly and the author cleverly keeps the reader guessing as to the outcome, although she drops a clue, whether intentional or not, about a quarter of the way from the end.  For this reason I found the last, inevitable, scene somewhat drawn out, but this is a minor quibble only. I have not seen the film but I imagine it makes quite good cinema and/or TV. Highly recommended.;Book
"The girl on the train , Rachel, is depressed, her self esteem is very low , she loses contact with reality and fantasyses. She is lonely but does not look for help.She has a bad relationship with her mother and lies to her.She has never overcome the loss of her husband. She acts on her own while knowing that alcohol blurs her mind. Besides curiosity takes her to interfere into other people's affairs.She misleads the investigation .I found the novel a bit slow , it only accelerates in the last chapters.The characters are dark and full of inner conflicts.Rachel has a very low self esteem, she is depressed and drinks. She has not overcome her marriage failure .She interferes and tries to manage on her own.She is lonely ; even the relationship with her mother is distant.Megan is unhappy and wants to leave everything behind, she even tries a relationship with her psichologist and later we are told that she has had an affair with Tom.She has had a dark past.Anna is also unhappy, has left her job Gallery to look after Evie and is haunted by Rachel stocking her.Later she does no longer trust her husband and she even reads his private mail.Male characters play as second characters , only at the end Tom gives a step ahead.There are no happy characters here.I found it difficult to jump from characters in the different chapters and it tired me a bit.The end was surprising and the rythm accelerated and became attractive.";Book
I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!;Book
Well, I'm just a regular reader, no professional reviewer or anything, but I have a lot to say about this amazing book.This ingenius novel is a fascinating look at how everybody is very different, everybody is a little similar, and those similarities and differences can twist together in amazing ways in the end.The characters are very human, being both likable and, at the same time, people we can't help but look down on.  But the characters' complexity emerges as the book gets further along, so that before you know it, you've been guilty of character assassination when you shouldn't have been.  You've been rooting for things you shouldn't have been.  You've been caught up in things in all the wrong ways.  And it happened to you right under your own nose.This book is a great ride! Twisting, turning, pulling you around.  I am an avid reader, and even I was surprised.By the time the ending is approaching, a moral has actually formed in your mind.  You don't even realize it because you've had such a good time.  But a while after you are done with the book, if you take the time to think about it, it's there.What a great book.;Book
I did not enjoy this book at all.  Chapters are written from the perspective of one character at a time and the timing jumps all over the place.  The story is told from over the course of 3 years but jumps back and forth during that time and is not well written.  This is not a book that is suspenseful as portrayed by the synopsis.  Things that are mentioned and you think they will play a part in the book just disappear, never to be referenced again.  I had figured out who the bad guy was very early on in the book.  And the main character, Rachel, just makes you want to grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.  If you like to read about weak women that can easily be lead by men, then by all means, read the book.  I read this because it was the choice for the monthly book club that I am a part of - I will now be deleting it from my kindle, never to be read again.;Book
I didn't know what to expect when I bought this but I knew it was becoming a movie and wanted to read the book first. It is an easy quick read. There are a fair amount of characters and the book is written from the point of view of multiple characters, but it is easily identified who is speaking and it is written chronologically so it is still easy to understand. Some twists, enough to keep you interested and not wanting to put it down. Reminded me of Gone Girl a little bit with the story and the style of writing. I liked it better than Gone Girl for sure, but gone girl was a bit more surprising to me. Overall a good book, nothing that I would list in my top 10 favorites, but I also wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either. I would recommend reading it before seeing the movie because the book is better (as always) but the movie wasn't bad either. Actually, the acting in the movie was pretty good, the plot in the movie was just different than the book.;Book
I did not like the book at all...not enough to give it even one star.  Apparently one must give a book one star to be able to offer an opinion.  Something within me compels me to finish any book I begin, just to see when, or if, the story will ever get better.  This one never got better, at least not to me.  Imagine taking a handful of broken characters from an assortment of soap operas and jumbling them together.  This might be the result.  I must look at the publishing house.  I will use extra caution before buying from them again.  I did find this book on a suggested reading list, so someone liked it, but certainly not this reader.  I'm sorry I have nothing good to say...usually there is something good. Afraid I could find nothing good this time.  Sorry...money poorly spent.  My loss.;Book
I bought several books to get through the summer with. For some reason I kept putting this one at the end of the pile.  When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends. This is where it takes off like a locomotive and twists and turns around every bend. Truly a thriller that makes you hold on and gasp for air! By all means, order directly from Amazon NOW!;Book
"I must say that the book kept my attention through all the complicated manipulative story line . Though from the beginning I hated Rachel for the boring drunk she was, Megan for the unreliable self occupied deeply disturbed woman she was and Anna for the stupid and immoral person she was. Not to think about the psychopath (ATTENTION, SPOILER!) . That the only interest in life these women had was the love of a man is so sad, are really women like that or is it , as I think, a very cliched and insulting idea of  woman? That the author thinks that these women might be considered ""real"" is very disappointing.";Book
My first thought after reading this book was “yup, it lived up to the hype”. This is a fantastic debut novel- one that I won’t soon forget. Does it live up to the Gone Girl status? Yes, in a way it does. The story has the same type of unreliable narrator who is suffering from her own problems and us readers don’t know whether to believe her or not. Can we readers guess who is behind Megan’s disappearance? Nope. I wanted to think I knew who did it, but when I really found out I was as shocked as everyone else. This book is awesome, albeit, a bit dark and depressing. I had so many feelings while reading this that my head started to spin! Honestly, if you haven’t picked this one up yet than I implore you to do so. It’s just a very, very, good book! No wonder it got a goodreads award!Anyway, the book is about a woman named Rachel who rides the same commuter train every day. At first I wanted to believe it was because she had to work like everyone else, but I was lead to believe wrong. You see, Rachel is hiding from her demons. She lost her job because she is an alcoholic and is trying to hide this news from her flat mate. It’s crazy how well Rachel is hiding her wrong-doings and I can’t help as a reader feeling a bit bad for her. So what Rachel does on this train (each, and every day) is watch the houses go by. But not only this, she fantasizes about the people who live there. You see, she is already familiar with this neighborhood as she used to live there- with her husband- until he left her for another woman. And stranger things continue to happen- her ex-husband now lives in the same house he shared with her, with the woman he left her for. Pretty twisted if you ask me! Either way, Rachel’s fantasizing, her mixed up emotions for her ex-husband and his new wife, and now a murder mystery begins to plague Rachel’s life. She starts with one bad decision- and her life begins to spin even more out of control than it was previously. Yikes! The happenings in this book are quite unbelievable and twisted.Overall, I loved everything about this book. It’s dark, twisted, depressing, and unique. The author has quite the imagination and she certainly brings it to life in this book. Again, if you haven’t read it than you should! It’s awesome. I can’t wait to see what the author thinks up next!;Book
"""The Girl on the Train” is a debut psychological thriller by Paula Hawkins who was a journalist for fifteen years before she turned her hand to fiction.  The setting of the novel is in London during the summer told through three female voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.The protagonist, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who witnesses a murder while on a commuter train.  However, because of her inability to remember things, her constant blackouts and incapability to separate fact from fiction; makes others not believe that she saw a murder.  Even though she has problems with staying sober and focused, Rachel is persistent in trying to find out what happened and why.I feel this is a good debut book for those that like psychological thrillers.  Ms. Hawkins has a good writing style even though I felt the action did not really take off until about the last 75 pages of the book. My deltas are I hated every character in the book because they seemed to not have any redeeming values and worked hard to hurt everyone they knew.  Furthermore, the story dragged in the middle and the ending seemed a little too pat.Overall, it had a good story line and I felt it may change how we look at the lives of others we encounter daily. I look forward to reading Ms. Hawkins next thriller.";Book
"From page one this book grabbed my attention and held on until the very end. It has been awhile since I read a book this fast. I loved the way it was presented from the points of view of the three female characters. Nothing is quite as it appears. What we perceive from a distance can be very different from the reality. I was drawn into the complex lives of each of these women and ultimately how they were all connected. The fact that the story is somewhat dark and moody only made it more intriguing for me. I loved the writing, the depth of the female characters, especially Rachel, and how easily I could ""see"" each scene in my mind. Having heard mixed reviews about this book, I didn't rush to read it, but scenes from the newly released movie made me curious and I heard that some liked the movie better than the book. Needless to say now that I read and loved the book, I definitely want to see the movie. One of the best well-written books I have read in quite awhile.";Book
"I read this book in almost a matter of hours. I became interested when I saw that this book would be made into a movie, and when I heard from friends how great and thrilling it was. I love reading, but I am a very visual person and if the words don't make me feel like I am actually there, experiencing everything like I was actually there, I have a harder time getting through. I was on the edge of my seat, and my heart ached for the main character... couldn't he see what he was doing to her? Why didn't he understand? Why was she having to suffer through this almost completely alone? Who did it?The little hints that Paula Hawkins drops to foreshadow the twisted events at the end are so subtle yet set the mood in a terrifyingly gut-wrenching way that makes you wish you could jump into the book screaming. The imagery was incredible and the descriptions strung together like poetry. I could smell the alcohol on her breath, I could feel the train moving, I could feel her despair. The character development is so deep, that you can't help but love and hate each and every character.It has a ""Gone Girl"" feel with its own unique flair and psychological twist, with an ending you won't see coming.";Book
"I read _Girl on a Train_ since I knew that the film of the same name was based on the Hawkins' novel. The author's style of writing and structure, with main characters offering differing perspectives of the same events, was v similar to the genre of postmodern ""woman in distress"" novels represented best by _Gone Girl_.  As in _Gone Girl_, Hawkins presents us w a femme fatale (or two perhaps) who may or may not have precipitated their own disappearance or dissolution--or salvation. _Girl on a Train_ is a masterful psychological thriller. The novel develops well developed  characters whose outlines come into focus through, among other things, razor sharp dialogue and merciless introspection. What I also found particularly enjoyable about the novel was Hawkins' slow emergence of a short London suburban street and endlessly looping train as a character in its own right, both a geographical and psychological site of cultural and personal imprisonment.";Book
I downloaded a sample of this book quite awhile ago, but never managed to engage. So many people insisted it was the best book they had read this year, so I finally just hunkered down and dug in. The story is captivating enough, so I imagine that that was a big part of what the fuss is all about. And a female alcoholic protagonist is a new twist on the old unreliable narrator. My problem was that I didn't care for the characters. Not that I disliked them, they just left me cold. Plus, it was pretty easy for me to see where the story was headed, about half way through the book. I read on, hoping for a more interesting plot twist, but when the reveal came, it was unrealistic the way that the perpetrator just came right out and blurted all the details of the murder. So, why 4 stars? Because I'm impressed by all the hoopla have and every time an author attracts the kind of readership that encourages others to pick up a book, I put my own subjective opinion aside, to a degree. Right or wrong, keep reading and reviewing!;Book
"This site hardly needs another review of ""The Girl on the Train"", but I wanted to say that I felt that the comparisons to ""Gone Girl"", while understandable, were not really as germane as they first appear.  Yes, both books use the unreliable narrator technique, and bad things happen to bad people.  But I felt ""The Girl on the Train"" to be the superior novel.  Not only was the character development better, the book didn't strain the bounds of reader credulity as did ""Gone Girl.""  The sexual crudeness of ""Gone Girl"", the unnecessary profanity that was actually pretty disgusting, was also absent in ""The Girl on the Train.""  I simply felt Paula Hawkins to be the better writer.  I disagree with those that say that Rachel is an unsympathetic character.  People actually do have debilitating problems with alcohol, and blackouts do happen.  I couldn't put the book down, and I didn't hurl it across the room in disgust at the ending as I did ""Gone Girl.""  That's a real recommendation.";Book
A real page turner.  You root for her and then you aren't sure you should. I recommend this on for sure.;Book
The overall story line was interesting and I liked that it was told from multiple perspectives, however, it was a bit too predictable to me to really be a psychological thriller.;Book
Don't let the beginning of this story stop you from keeping reading.  It starts out slow, but good heavens, does it get GOOD!  You'll be shocked!;Book
"It's unusual to meet a cast of characters that all elicit some degree of sympathy but even the ""monster"" does here but they do and their stories keep your attention riveted to their tracks.";Book
It was entertaining but I started sighing half way through and could hardly wait for them to just get on with things. Will not recommend it to anyone.;Book
Edge of your seat suspense  and great plot twists!! Would definite recommend to anyone looking for an easy read that isn't boring;Book
read this over a  year ago...not sure if first person or not.  But a good read.;Book
Interesting but one of those books where you want to choke the main character.;Book
I was recommended this book by a friend, not the usual genre I read. I should have read it sooner. Amazing book, it will stick with me for some time.;Book
Very interesting story of the young couple life. Quite complicated , psychologically explore dark side of human spirit. Very believable , almost realistic.;Book
I could not put this book down it was such an amazing novel. I would definitely recommend this to people who love a good mystery.;Book
I loved how the story was told through 3 characters eyes. It was suspenseful,and at times had you rooting for and against the characters.;Book
It was difficult to get hooked into this book and understand what was going on but stick with it. Once you do you are hooked and can't put it down. What a surprise ending!;Book
I've recommended this book to everyone. The story is well crafted, the characters interesting and the plot is full of twists and turns. The character development is amazingly subtle, yet powerful. A great read.;Book
If I could give it 0 stars I would. This books is so slow and boring. It was a waste of my time and money. Would not recommend this book to anyone.;Book
Very quick read couldn't put the book down. Just when I thought I figured it out the story added another twist. I recommend it and suggest it would be a great read on a rainy weekend.;Book
This was an excellent book. It keeps you guessing and engaged. It was a great story line and love the way the author takes you from past to presences to fill in the gaps and set the plot. I really enjoy it.;Book
May have been slow to start but sucked me right in after a few chapter's.  The characters were so well defined, the plot so dark and twisted, I'm sorry I finished it. Now what?;Book
Very good novel. Good detail, keeps you guessing. I enjoyed it very much;Book
ok;Book
I enjoyed the book, it's a mystery wrapped in a mystery that keeps the reader engaged enough at least to finish the book. There are a lot of implausible actions taken by almost all of the (somewhat unbelievable) main characters that really stretch the reader's ability to willingly suspend disbelief. It's almost distracting. But overall, I'm not mad that I spent the time reading this book. It's not amazing though, I'm a little surprised that it made multiple best-seller lists. And surprised that they made a movie out of it (which is not even as good as the book... don't bother seeing after reading the book, the movie actually does a WORSE job of telling the story). Do I HIGHLY recommend the book? No, I lukewarmly recommend the book. Read it if it's handy. I'd send you my copy but I already mailed it to a friend so they don't have to buy one.;Book
I really don't get all the hype on this book. The writing is amateur at best. The story and the characters are underdeveloped, all they feel is sad and sorry for themselves. Each woman was more annoying than the next.It started out ok, intriguing and mysterious, but 20% into it I was over it and needed the story to end. I hate slow books.It was too depressing to continue. I was 60% into the story when i decided I didn't want to continue reading it anymore. So I found out about the ending from a reviewer. Only reason I gave this two stars is because the beginning really captivated me and I desperately wanted to enjoy the book.;Book
"I can't imagine comparing this book to Gone Girl! They have nothing in common whatsoever, other than the fact that both are written in a way that you don't like the main characters. But this is part of the interest in Gone Girl - you want to keep reading to see what happens to these awful people. Here, I hated the characters, but I wanted to finish quickly and move on to another book.I found the plot unbelievable. Why would the police not arrest this drunk woman for interfering with their investigation? Perhaps things are different in Britain, but I don't think US cops would allow her to keep wandering (or should I say staggering) into their investigation. The ""evidence"" she has to offer is so very flimsy, the fact that the author tries to force it into this investigation becomes annoying long before the book ends.If you haven't read Gone Girl, read it! If you have read Gone Girl, pick something else from whatever genre you enjoy. It will probably be better than this one!!";Book
It took me about 6-8 months before I wanted to read this book.  I asked several people I saw reading the book what they thought and a lot of people said it was just OK.  When I started this book I almost put it right back down.  I did not like the authors writing style.  It was choppy.  After about 2 chapters I was hooked.  Although the style is choppy throughout, this book held my interest totally.  I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed all the characters, and I could feel emotion with each one.  I felt she developed the characters beautifully.  Normally I don't like this jumping back and forth between characters but in this case it was totally necessary to get a total view of what each character was feeling.  I thought the ending was not as great as the rest of the book but it was by no means a deal breaker.  I would highly recommend this book.;Book
"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them.";Book
(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail).;Book
I purchased this book because of the raving reviews. Many said this was the next Gone Girl. However, I found this novel very difficult to read for several reasons. First, there are many perspectives and many time lines happening during the book that I wasn't paying true attention to until about a quarter of the way through. For ex. One perspective takes place Fri in Aug while in a few pages the next perspective takes place Fri in June. The second reason I found this novel difficult to get through is the main character. She is a drunk that I had a hard time empathetizing with. Character development was extremely slow. Half these chapters didn't even need to exist. I felt as if she was just nonstop whining about her life, being drunk, and hating her life. Not a pleasurable read in the least bit.I tried several times putting the book down and starting it back up again in a few days but I just couldn't finish it. I like to read for enjoyment. If I wanted to read about a drunk who couldn't keep a job I would just go on Facebook.;Book
"I did enjoy this book -- it's a quick read and the plot does hold one's attention. It's also refreshing to have a narrator (there are several, but Rachel seems to be the primary one) who is not especially likable; it's a change of pace from the norm.But there were a lot of things about ""The Girl on the Train"" that nagged at me. Yes, it's a thriller, but it went deeper and deeper into implausibility as it proceeded, and I felt like the whole thing could have been wrapped up 50 pages sooner. Rachel's decline, while realistic, also strains credulity a bit -- I will not spoil things, but I felt the supporting characters would not have let her go so far.I would give the book four stars but for one key failing: Every woman in this book is defined entirely by her relationship with men. Being in relationships, being mothers, being loved and ""cared for"" -- that's all that seems to matter to them. (And the men are boorish, smug cads.) One might not seek complexity in a book like this, but I was surprised by the misogyny.";Book
"I generally try to use reviews to choose what I wish to read in part. After reading a few reviews, I kind of knew what I was getting into. I did not expect the tone of the book to be what it was though. It was dark, somewhat twisted- no, I mean a lot twisted. The characters all had personal demons. Wading through the trough of the harsh lives, cheating and treachery of the characters, I tried to see a thread of where Ms. Hawkins was taking the story. Brushing the fumes of alcohol aside and the blackout laden plot, I started to have my own theories build. The theories waxed and waned. I solved the mystery 4 or 5 times before enough detail became evident to reason it out. It was a good effort on Hawkin's part. I don't know if I would put it in the same class as "" Rear Window"" though. It is just another type of story- I think that's why I gave it the 4 stars. The lack of the final star is a common complaint I have of these types of novels. They introduce all at once a part of the plot you could not see at all- nor imagine. It is not a bunch of chess pieces scrambled on a board that slowly rearrange themselves to reveal a final end. Instead these types of stories create critical clues out of the blue that fill in vital pieces of a picture never possible before the clues are revealed. I'd rather have all the pieces laid out there and when the fog lifts, you find yourself saying"" I should have seen it! Great job"". Nevertheless,  it was still a good story, filled with the sick helpless feelings being lost and depressed if things in a ""perfect world"" we're to suddenly go bad. You might want to go outside after finishing this book and look out at a clear sunny day and praise the good fortune of being healthy, happy  and trusting enough to believe all people have good in them. With this book Ms. Hawkin's cuts through this ""good"" as fantasy and paints a different picture of what we are or can be. Somehow, the will to survive and rising above it all- hoping we are still decent at our core may endure. But, you will have to read it to see if that is true.";Book
"I enjoyed this book and was even a tiny bit paranoid for a couple of days after. When I finished I thought I should have been disappointed, but I wasn't. ""Should've been"" because the main characters were not really very likable, bits of imagery from the story seemed implausible, and the writing style - three women telling the story all in the first person can be confusing especially if you put it down midway through one of them. ""Wasn't"" disappointed because an alcoholic trying to piece together information from her blackouts to solve a mystery was intriguing from the start, even if it's been done before, and I was fascinated to be allowed into the mind of this character I didn't much care for in the same way reading about a different place can transport you out of your normal everyday experiences, even when it's not just where you want to be. I imagine Hitchcock would have liked the ending as he used a similar theme in one of his stories ... I won't say which.";Book
"Almost everyone I know has read this book. I wish they had warned me that the first half of the book was five or six characters in search of a plot-line. The girl on the train was an emotional trainwreck, whinging on and on about her past while she drank herself into blackouts. The other characters that were presented were similarly self-absorbed. At about the halfway point there was some development of a storyline and it quickly became obvious who the bad guy had to be. The final quarter of the book quickly laid out the storyline, solved the riddle and revealed the culprit -- no surprise.If you liked ""Gone Girl"" this is similar, but not comparable. The characters are so nebulous and self-absorbed that it was impossible to care what happened to them. The plot wandered a lot which could have been interesting, but somehow it was not. I gave it two stars because it was well-written.";Book
"I agree with others who found the characters all so interchangeable and vile, their dialogue one lie after the other. The author's use of 3 first person monologues ever mixing was so annoying, though I get why she did it. It got so I couldn't tell who was doing the talking half the time, that's what I mean by ""interchangeable."" They were all awful, awful people. I got so frustrated with this that I rushed to finish it so I could be ""rid"" of it for good. Not one redeeming factor in any of these characters, all utterly without morals or apparently, will power... they deserved the misery this book was. I will skip Ms. Hawkins' next work and I don't intend to go see the film just released of this. My curiosity has been fed. But I had to see for myself if this was worthy of all the hoopla being made over it. Not in my world. Another ""Gone Girl""? Not even close.";Book
Not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.They just made a movie out of it and made comparisons to Gone Girl which I had read.  It is not of the same caliber as Gone Girl.  Gone Girl was more suspenseful and moved along much faster.  This book was confusing and depressing more than dark.  The main character is a drunk.  It was a matter of figuring out who killed Megan.  I will leave that to those of you who want to read this.  There really are not that many convincing twists in this book and the outcome is really not a huge surprise in my view.  The Author tries to obfuscate it but really fails as it is too contrived.  I found the first 2/3 of the book pretty slow going.  Only in the last 1/3 did things really pick up some, but then it was just letting the pieces fall into place and frankly I was not surprised in the least.  Good luck with this one.  I consider it pretty much a waste of time reading this one.;Book
The Girl On The Train is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn't get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!;Book
Since all the characters were unlikeable, didn't care who did it and wish they had all been killed.The IDEA of things observed/story lines created from train window was intriguing, getting this one at least 1 star.But...I hated every minute of reading it.;Book
"What a fantastic page turner, murder mystery, psychological drama with three really troubled women each telling their story.  Rachel, an out of bounds alcoholic with an out of bounds imagination and jealousy; not a very likable person, for sure, but I did keep rooting for her.  Megan, hollow and shallow and haunted by her past and Anna, the young, naive, trusting, suspicious wife and mother......Add three flawed men and you get a marvelously written gripping, entertaining delight. Wish I had been on a long plane flight and not trying to distract myself from the election.  Did not come away with any profound insights about life......just loved, loved the marvelous, entertaining distractions; the details of modern day transportation (trains) in England.  Yes, it is a bit depressing and dark; but it's a murder mystery...Isn't that what reading is all about?";Book
. . .  restraint writing this book.  For the reader this book is like a present with 336 layers of wrapping paper that are slowly removed to get to the gift within.  I am not saying this is a lovely story.  It is not.  It is ugly and scary, but it is written so beautifully that I enjoyed every word.  I was so enthralled with the writing that it took me awhile to realize that it is narrated by several people.  It was a smack myself in my doofuss head moment, but it didn't bother me at all to start the book again paying attention to who was speaking.Even if you do figure out who the bad person is early it doesn't matter because it's the story and how it unfolds that is important.  This book is full of pathetic, flawed people, but I felt hope at the end.I am not sure  I will see the movie.  I like suspenseful books, but I don't like scary movies even when I know what happens.;Book
"It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, ""The Girl on the Train"" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality. Recommended.Diana Faillace Von Behren""Buzzard's Eye View""";Book
"The 3 stars are for the 1st 1/3 of the book.  After that, you still hang in there, but the claim that ""you won't see it coming!"" is bunk.  The author is really talented, but she goes down a very predictable path, and to me, both drops a bomb and advertises it's imminent arrival.  I wish she hadn't gone for the birthday party surprise (when you could clearly see your friends' cars parked in your neighborhood) and just taken it to another conclusion less like ""the butler did it gotcha!"" kind of thing.";Book
Was excited to read this book but now that I have I'm not sure what all the hype was about.  I hope they tweaked the movie to make it better.  The jumping back and forth between time and characters was somewhat confusing at times because the first person narrative of the three different characters all sounded the same so sometimes one wondered who exactly was talking because they all sounded very similar.  I'm disappointed I spent the money for the Kindle version.  I don''t even know I would have been okay with spending $3-4 at the used bookstore either.;Book
"In a word: crap.I took this book with me on a beach vacation because I wanted something to breeze through, something to entertain me. I do not ask for much in my beach reads: plot, some coherent writing, character development. I gave this book more than a fair shot. But I'm stopping at page 175.Poor writing, flat characters, and the author's sexist tone seeps off every page. Every female psychosis is on display here: dressing the part, feeling worthless, feeling like a child, sexual motivation behind how men act, women's revenge, ""I'm a force to be reckoned with,"" ""all these men,"" the list goes on....I can't take it anymore. Life is too short to read bad books like this one.I hate it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon";Book
"The three principal characters in THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN have much in common. They're not very likable, they're depressing, and they don't have much taste in men.Rachel is the girl on the train. She's lost her job for drinking on the job. Her husband has left her for another woman, and to top matters off, he's had a baby with his new wife, with whom he was carrying on an affair while still married to Rachel. That's what broke up Rachel's marriage; she couldn't have a baby. She takes the train to work every day to fool her land lady roommate (the nicest woman in the book) into thinking she still has a job. The part about the train has to do with two people she sees almost every day on their veranda. She doesn't know them, but she convinces herself they're the happy couple. She even gives them names. They live a few doors down from where she used to live with her husband Tom.The second woman is Megan. Megan lives with a horrible secret I won't reveal here. Let's say, psychologically, it has affected her. She's the woman in the ideal couple, but she's far from ideal. She sleeps around; she even makes a move on her therapist. It's not clear whether he sleeps with her, but Rachel does see them kissing from the train.  Megan also winds up dead. That's the best part of the book as far as suspense is concerned. I read a lot of mysteries, and usually I can tell who did it within the first fifty pages, but there are several candidates here, and I didn't know who killed Megan until the author told me.The third woman might be the creepiest of all. She had an affair with Tom and she knew he was married. She even reveled in it. The woman is close to a sociopath. She only cares about her own little world, her husband and her baby. When she is confronted with a physical threat she runs away. Some might argue that she's only protecting her baby, but it seems to be more than that. She also does something creepy during the denouement to someone who can't defend himself/herself.I really don't see how this book has stayed on the best seller list for most of the year. As I said above, about the only redeeming quality is the “who done it” aspect. It's also hard to believe that Megan, who worked at an art gallery before it closed, would babysit for people she barely knew, that is unless you consider that the author needed her to. Her horrible secret also involves a baby. This is called author intrusion, and it's a bad “no no” for literary critics.";Book
The Girl on The Train by Paula Hawkins… OMG! This has to be one of my absolute favorite reads in 2015! Murder, obsession, evil, jealousy, cruelty and heartbreaking at times, The Girl on The Train has what it takes to keep you turning those pages and let me tell you… the twist at the end will have your jaw drop! It is so deceptively simple in some ways, that as you are reading, suddenly the sun is setting, day turns into night and your eyes have not left the page. I wasn't furiously turning the pages, I was absentmindedly turning the pages because I was so engrossed in the story.Here's the gist… Rachel Watson rides the train everyday past a housing complex and becomes obsessed with this couple she sees most days lounging on their patio… until Rachel sees something that she shouldn't see. But because Rachel has some problems of her own, when she tries to tell someone what she saw, no one believes her… until… Read this book! Both a great murder mystery and literary fiction. Well written characters, a leading lady that you can empathize with, and a great story. If Hitchcock were to write murder mysteries, this would be it!I give this 5+ Train Tickets! Hop aboard and enjoy;Book
A friend suggested this book to me,knowing that Emily Blunt would be playing Rachel in the movie. I started it a couple times, but couldn't get into it. The switching back and forth between characters was really confusing to me and I couldn't tell what was what. Then after my husband read it, he explained that once you get to a certain point it makes more sense and at least the characters are made clear. It did become more suspenseful and then I just needed to know who did it. My thoughts wavered a few times between the characters, but in the end it was not my first pick. It all made sense then and I'm glad it turned out the way it did. I'm glad Rachel and Anna helped each other in the end. Still a pretty creepy story though. Reminds me of all the sick stories you hear about in the news. Unfortunately, there really are people out there doing these terrible things. Scary!;Book
The Girl on the Train occupies a similar space as Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. In both, we move through the minds of multiple narrators who may or may not be lying, to us and/or to themselves. This ends up being very effective and is what pulls you forward into the story, despite the fact that the inciting incident doesn't rear its head for thirty or forty pages.While there are three characters we focus on throughout the book, the first is arguably the main character: Rachel. She has been divorced for two years and is a serious alcoholic. She blames her drinking for her current state and for the end of her marriage. She's living with a friend, paying rent, and lost her job several months ago. Too ashamed to admit it to anyone, she continues to take the train into the city every day.The train stops regularly in the same place, behind some houses in a nice little town. From her vantage point on the train, Rachel watches a married couple go about their morning. She calls them Jess and Jason, though she doesn't have any idea what their real names are. She's constructed a perfect little life for them in her head.But it falls apart the morning Rachel sees Jess kissing another man on her back porch. And shortly after that, Jess goes missing entirely.I won't say more for fear of spoiling what is genuinely a good story. Just know that we get multiple perspectives on the events, and everyone is much more connected than may first be apparent. Highly recommended if you're into Gone Girl and that sort of dark, psychological thriller. A well-constructed mystery with compelling characters.;Book
"In a nutshell: it was ok.Let me start by briefly explaining why I chose this book. Everyone seemed to be raving about it. Even NYPL! So, as usual.. I thought: I need thisin my life! I had (unfortunately) high expectations about this book and I didn't even bother to read what was it about. I read that it was similarto Gone Girl, I even quote: ""“The Girl on the Train has more fun with unreliable narration than any chiller since Gone Girl. . . . [It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.”—The New York Times"".In my opinion, it is just an ok book. I still have my doubts if it is a cleverly plotted thriller. Paula Hawkings indeed tried to present compelling characters,but to me, they were a bit too predictable and in some cases, annoying. Now, it alternates between three points of view (all females), and to me, tends to fall to unnecessary (not always, but in this case) and gimmicky. Basically the whole mystery is a mess right up until the last chapters, where you get a grip of the situation. The ending for me was extremely melodramatic, and I thought for a minute I just read a Hollywood movie. Very few real twists, first chapters are monotonous. Plain and simple: just mediocre.While on Gone Girl we saw how the author fought back against female cliches of the accommodating victim or love interest with a cold, calculating villain, The Girl on the Train takes a less defiant angle. The main character: Rachel is delivered through an unwittingly unreliable narration to evoke the aftershocks of abuse and trauma. Do I think this was a powerful way of exploring women's marginalization? Not entirely. I am not 100% convinced. I did not like any of the characters, and to be quite honest, the male roles were a bit stereotyped (that is just my impression). I do not get what is the hype about this book? It isn't a bad one, but surely not a master piece either! It is a bit depressing even?Conclusion:*It is an ok book, touching the limits with mediocre? Take this book for your summer holidays at the most. Do not expect a deep, fascinating suspense book.*Boring, a little bit depressing? At the end picks up the pace and you feel more hooked.*Complex but a bit predictable characters.*Easy to read!";Book
"This book, read from the perspectives of three different women on divergent and convergent timelines, leaves quite a bit to be desired. Paula's writing is difficult to follow, the characters are mostly unlikable and make very questionable decisions. Common sense is apparently lacking in this particular part of England.What started off as a novel premise eventually meanders its way into half-truths, mis(sing)-information, and lots of ""surprises"" that are less surprises and more like the guy who tells a joke but has to keep going back and adding in more detail because he forgot. This frustrating novel is really just a  long joke, with lots of ""oh yeahs"" and ""I forgot"" (literally).If all of the characters involved got hit by the titular train I think this book would be more compelling. Alas, that's not the case and we're left with the sour aftertaste of characters ripped from a Maury Povich show.";Book
I’m no expert when it comes to this genre or analyzing a writer’s intent. I took the book as a personal look at myself. One who live a good portions of my life in the same state as Rachel , but with a different storyline..it was all darkness. Never looking back at the ones criticizing , I fail into their opinion of me. It took and still does take years to look back and dissect them. Rachel at the end started to see the people around as they were.. as I have. The book as read it , was all in darkness, as my former life was. As I formed a kinship with Rachel , I found empathy for her – you ( I )may have an understanding of what was , but the darkness remains. Other reviews –reviewers can, I’m sure give , a more distant view of this book, but I can’t. A couple weeks have past since I read the book, but when I pick up my reader I still feel its impact of it on me. But the book was like an AA meeting, as you hear others , you get a better understanding of yourself and the past. Please read other reviews by others, who can see this book outside of the forest , I have not gotten far enough out to see it.;Book
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.;Book
"Disappointing after all the hype. The plot was twisted and unpredictable, which was good, but I stopped caring about what happened because the characters were so uninteresting. The story was told from the point of view of three female characters: Rachel, the primary character, was whiny and weak, still pining for a broken marriage with a nasty two-timer; Anna, the woman he cheated with, didn't come to life at all; and Megan, a neighbor of Anna's, seemed to be calmly narrating her fate even while expiring. In any case, I failed to connect with any of them. And the male characters, without giving the ending away, were disturbing and violent. It takes more than these one-dimensional people to make a mystery novel interesting. This one failed to deliver.";Book
Loved the book copy and I would love to see the movie to this wonderful book that keyed me on the edge of my seat.;Book
I'm about halfway through the book and I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!! I just know something disastrous or crazy is about to happen.;Book
I enjoyed this book. The short prose of each character kept it flowing smoothly and kept me intrigued. Good read.;Book
Five stars.  I never knew what was going to happen and it was always a surprise.  A very good book.;Book
I found the writing elegant but the back and forth between the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan was unnecessarily complex and often repetitive.;Book
The book could have been better paced. But it is undeniably a very good thriller. I think it could have been shorter and the suspense would have still been the same.;Book
Told from the point of view of three women, the mystery surrounding the disappearance of one of the women is revealed.  The first person narrative allows the author to obscure the details based on personal perspective and keeps the reader on their toes until the very end.;Book
Really great book. You really don't know who did the crime until the characters do. A must read for anyone who loves figuring out puzzles.;Book
Considering the characters' POV and personal issues, I consider this a tragic story rather than a suspenseful mystery.;Book
Just finished re reading this great book before I see the movie.  Hope that they stay true to most of the book!;Book
Made me want to see the movie.;Book
Very exciting read.  I have to admit that I got a little disgusted at times with the lead character.  Had some elements of GONE GIRL in it I thought.  Keeps you in suspense and worth reading.;Book
i wasn't sure about this book in the beginning, but it got better as it went along. It was worth keeping up.;Book
excellent story. Figured out the end about 80% through but still a very exciting ending. Really worth the read. Once you're into it a real page turner. Great read for both men and women.;Book
I couldn't put this book down. Great thriller! You fall in love with characters that you'd typically hate, this Author actually makes you fall in love with these very flawed characters.;Book
GOod first novel, but left dissappointed and the read itself was overly contrived. Will be curious as to how they handle it in the movie...;Book
This is an interesting mystery that will keep you in suspense.  Good story Have not seen the movie.;Book
This book kept me guessing the entire time. I definitely needed s one wine at the end. Great book and can't wait to read more of her books.;Book
I watched the movie first , I thought the book would be awful because I fell so in love with the movie but j was wrong I was just as wrapped into the book!;Book
Started with great interest....was a little redundant and ending was not as much of a  mystery as I thought it was going to be;Book
I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  Paula Hawkins has a very unique style.  If you like a good mystery, I would recommend reading this book.;Book
Now know why this has been on the Best Sellers so long. Great page-turner of a story. Lot's of twists to the plot. Loved it!;Book
Movie worthy Story, with solid gripping suspense.;Book
Gripping and Intriguing. Very well written! There will def be a movie is there isn't one in the works already!;Book
Book kept me in suspense. Great read highly recommend can't put they book downCan't wait to read second book;Book
If I could I would give this 6 stars. Read it in one day simply because I couldn't put it down!;Book
The use of , His, Hers and He and She, instead of using a persons name was often confusing.I didn't particularly care for the format or the index.;Book
What a great read this turned out to be! I'm a HUGE fan of Gone Girl and this rivals it on my top 10 list. Very interesting and fast paced.;Book
It was a good read, but I didn't really connect with the characters, which seemed sort of flat for me.;Book
Loved this book! A NY times best seller, it was entertaining and a good read.;Book
I didn't want the motion picture to spoil the book, so I made sure to bump this reading up on my list. Overall it was good - the plot had just enough twists to hold my interest, and I appreciated the set-up of the chapters being narrated by different characters during overlapping periods of time. It allows you to see the same scene from the eyes of different characters. That being said, I did figure out the ending without meaning to. Maybe it's all those crime shows I watch. I guess I just can't be thrilled by the thrillers the way I used to be. I also found that a couple of the character's voices were too similar for their differing personalities, but that's just me being picky. I would recommend the book if you're looking for a plot with scandal and emotional turmoil with an underlying premise of the existential crisis that can result from love gone wrong.;Book
"I feel this book started slowly......a boring account of random details that jump back and forth. However, a little more than half way through I see the meaning of all those details as they start to merge together and tie my mind into a suspenseful clutch that kept me interested and unable to put the book down.Even after the ""big reveal"" towards the end there's still a lot of questions and suspense and the story draws to a conclusion. I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott? Did he find out what really happened?2) Did Rachel and/or Anna tell the police about Tom & Megan??Did I miss something?";Book
"I think that what the book lacked in the beginning and middle, it made up for in the ending. I, of course, won't spoil it here, but it is very slow up until the ending which was somewhat predictable. The characters, main included, are somewhat dry, and altogether predictable. I can't help but imagine that the book would have been a much better read if told from Anna's perspective, as she was one of the only complex characters. Affairs are the key point of the book, though none take turns away from the predictable. The book spoils itself around the middle--towards the end, providing 1-2 red herrings before finally settling into the finale; naturally tidying the story and hitting all of the tropes of a murder mystery unabashedly. For myself, I read the book expecting the caliber of story that a Gillian Flynn novel may provide, a good airport page-turner to get me through a flight. Though this was a book that bored me in the beginning, middle, hooked me 30 pages before the ending, and finally disappointed me. I usually refrain from giving negative reviews, but honestly I wish someone would have let me know that there was better junk-lit out there. Try Gillian Flynn, Stephen King, or anything really. If you are tremendously bored, give this one a go. I couldn't pay attention to this book and ended up playing with my napkin if that gives you any notion of how this book is read.";Book
Girl named Anna – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Megan – she’s a bit messed up. Girl named Rachel – she’s a bit messed up. Rachel likes to ride trains. One day she sees SOMETHING, and nothing is ever the same.To be honest, this book was a bit of a letdown. All the hype. All the intrigue. It just fell a little bit flat, and left me feeling deflated at the end. I thought there would be MORE.This story is told in alternating perspectives from three different women: Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each with their own set of unique baggage. I disliked them all so much, I can’t decide who I like the least – but this was an I-enjoy-not-liking-you dislike, if that makes sense. However, none of them really roused much empathy from me, and I only developed surface level feelings. Frankly, I just didn’t really care all that much about any them.Don’t get me wrong, it was good enough, and certainly held my interest. I read it pretty quickly, and definitely was invested in the story. The alternating perspectives, and the way it jumped around in time, though commonplace in books these days, was, for the most part, successful here. The writing was simple, and clipped along at a decent pace to grab and maintain my attention.All in all, I would say read it, but it’s a case of been-there-done-that for me. It obviously works for some people though, given it’s reigning status at the top of the bestsellers list. I also think it would make a great book club pick, as it’s short, quick, and full of plenty of chat-able fodder.For more, visit www.bookishtendencies.com;Book
I had a hard time getting into this at first, but I put it aside and went back a few weeks later. I just wasn't ready at first for the first-person accounts of all of the characters, written in present tense, it was confusing. But I decided to give this author a chance, so I went back to the first few chapters to see how she'd crafted the characters and dated the scenes. If finally fell into place, and I went right through it in a couple of days. I like the way she placed the blame, or allowed the reader to place blame, on other people, and finally when the true culprit came to light, I could breathe a sigh of relief, and was glad that people aren't always as they seem, and for the most part these characters had reasons for being the way they were. It's a well-written psychological drama/thriller.;Book
Rachel Watson is a down-on-her-luck young woman who rides the train in and out of London every day to hide the fact that she has lost her job from her roommate, and to maintain a tenuous link to what she once was: gainfully employed, happily married and sober. One particular house near the railway tracks fosters an increasingly unhealthy obesssion in Rachel on these daily trips, with its seemingly perfect couple who sit on the terrace. Is it a secret longing for what Rachel once had? Or something more forbidding, something on her own emotional doorstep?With its Hitchcock like setup and close similarity to Gillian Flynn’s work, ‘Girl on a Train’ opens with this compelling story question. Then Rachel’s blurred recollection of a crime she witnesses in a drunken stupor causes her to stumble through the lives of others, wreaking havoc on ex-neighbors, her ex-husband, and aggravating the police, who soon lose patience with Rachel’s drinking and lies. You may actually find yourself doing the same as she keeps hitting the bottle.But ultimately ‘Girl on a Train’ disappoints. It just can’t live up to its promising start.If ever there was an unreliable narrator, it’s Rachel.And this is part of the book’s problem: The reader is too often misled into feeling one way about a character, only to have it not be so. The mystery itself relies too heavily upon Rachel’s opportune blackouts, taking us to the edge of discovery only to learn that she just can’t quite remember what happened. Until she does. And then the murderer does something so dumb (keeping a key piece of evidence any killer worth their salt would surely have gotten rid of) that it violates the ‘maximum capacity’ rule of a worthy villain. He/she also manages to give the clichéd, expository summing up toward the end of the book, explaining in detail the crimes committed and the motives for committing them.Like Gillian Flynn’s books, the parallel to ‘Girl on a Train’ is apparent: multiple narrators switching back and forth in first person as the crime unravels, everyday people living lives of quiet desperation, marriages that appear to be perfect but aren’t. But whereas Flynn’s writing can soar, and her characters are rich and nuanced, Paula Hawkins’ prose is deliberate and too ordinary to make us want to spend so much time in her character’s heads. There are clarity issues in the story telling as well, not helped by the fact that all three narrators are young English women of the same age, same class, with similar backgrounds and voices.Girl on a train is a solid suspense read however, although mystery buffs will find themselves want more.;Book
I gave this book four stars because I really enjoyed reading it, and sometimes couldn't put it down. I would have given it five stars but for some reason I had a VERY hard time with the fact that Rachel rode the train everyday to pretend that she didn't lose her job. That she would get ready, ride the train in the morning, find something to do for eight hours, and then ride it home, just because she didn't want her landlord to find out she'd lost her job. Doing all of this while dealing with alcoholism and depression just doesn't sound believable to me. As long as she paid her rent on time, why would it matter if she lost her job?  Each chapter would be from a different person's point of view which would sometimes get annoying and confusing, but in the end made for a very mysterious and enjoying read.;Book
"Don't stop reading this book!  Once you get thought the first little bit (and it is not boring... just building slowly and with purpose), you won't be able to stop.  Like the trains that permeate the story, moving it along and giving it reason, the book begins slowly, like a chugging locomotive trying to pull its passengers, overcoming inertia, and then builds as the story weaves itself in and out of the lives of each character, ultimately racing along like a runaway train rushing headlong with its full inertia, dragging all the passengers (and you) to the final conclusion while making you unable and unwanting to put it down.  Once you figure out the mystery you will watch the characters as they put together the pieces and make decisions leading to their ultimate destinies... and you will be unable to turn away, watching, wishing.As you read, you meet each character through both her own eyes as well as through the eyes of others... very intriguing.  And I love the use of paralleling the characters and their lives... wonderful!  When you begin reading, you must pay attention to the dates... they are important.As a warning to those who become engrossed and completely absorbed into books and their characters I must say that during my first couple of chapters I did feel nauseous, but only because one of the main characters was ""feeling ill"" (and it was not due to content).  Again, this is only because I allow myself to really enter the lives of the characters.  But I am so happy that I did not let that deter me from continuing.  Read this book!";Book
"I bought this book, ""The Girl on the Train"" because I had heard that it was a great book, with lots of plot twists and turns.  I had heard that it was a similar type book to ""Gone Girl.""  It does have lots of plot twists.  It is similar in type to ""Gone Girl.""  It simply is not my kind of book.  I like mysteries -- and this book was definitely mysterious from beginning to end, but it was definitely too dark for me.  (So was ""Gone Girl, so I should have known better)  I don't want to give away the plot, but I will say this -- If you want a feel good book, this is definitely not the one for you.  I like to finish a book and feel better by the end.  I didn't see that happen here.  It was well written -- each chapter takes on the persona of one of the main characters, so you really do get to feel what they are feeling and doing.  It does bounce back and forth through time, but the chapter headings will let you know that.";Book
"Paula Hawkins hit the ball out of the park with ""Girl on the Train.""  It is very interesting and a page turner from the very first page.  Ms Hawkins slowly expands the story from a sole character riding the same scheduled trains to and from work every day, or so the reader is led to believe.  Nothing is as it seems.  There are two more women added as primary characters and here's the thing I've never experienced before, Ms Hawkins continues the story as each of these three women, seamlessly, speaking as each of them in the first person singular.  Just pay attention to dates and times of trains.  That's all I'm going to say.There are many, many reviews that you can read here that will tell you the whole plot.  I would never begin reading a book knowing the plot and I won't do that to you here.  What I will do is comment to people who have come to trust my taste as to whether they will enjoy this book.  Is it worth the money?  Is it worth your time?  To both I will say very big YES's !!!Paula Hawkins can write and reading her is such a pleasure after reading some of the junk that has been put out to us from really major writers.  You will enjoy the way she treats the English language and you will enjoy this very unusual story as it is narrated by three different women from their own points of view.Buy it.  Have a good read.";Book
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own.";Book
"Really, more of a 2.5 star review. The initial premise of a troubled woman who becomes engrossed in the ""passing lives"" of a couple whose home she sees daily from her train commute is a good one. Unfortunately, it was the highpoint of the book for me. I'd guessed the plot by about page 60, and really kept reading to see if I was correct. (I was) I truly kept hoping I would be surprised. The story is told from the point of view of three women: Rachel, Megan and Anna, with Rachel being the main character. She's a drunk. Eventually, she becomes an such erratic unlikable, needy repetitive drunk, I was just kind of hoping she'd jump from the train. The plot is facilitated by convenient blackouts, which I could buy into, but it's the clipped points of view of the other two characters that I found to be weak writing. The chapters from Megan and Anna's POV are limited because they're clearly holding back information they know--particularly Megan. A red flag example is a short Megan chapter dedicated to inner thoughts about her lover, whom she refers to as ""he."" The lack of a proper noun tells me the ""he"" she's having an affair with in this chapter is a different ""he"" than was mentioned by name in an earlier chapter. With only so many characters in the book, ""he"" became quite obvious. If you don't think too hard while reading, I can see where The Girl on the Train is an interesting book. I don't think the plot is anything close to masterful.";Book
The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling.;Book
It took quite an effort to get through it It really draggeedandwas depressing at least half way through it. After reading, I will skip the movie.;Book
This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing.;Book
I'm usually not a fan of mysteries like this because the ending seems to be obvious early on in most authors' writing. But it came highly recommended and I got it for a long airplane flight which proved to be a great idea!  It took the first person view of several of the women involved and really twisted the possibilities around. This was entertaining, suspenseful, not cookie-cutter at all, and actually had me guessing almost to the very end. I'll definitely recommend it to others and look for more books by this author.;Book
This book made feel goosebumps. Certain parts were written very well that it had me looking behind my shoulder. Good mystery had me guessing pretty much the whole way convincing me along the way that it could of been others. Only negative to me was that some parts felt like fillers pointless and dragging on very few though. I recommend this to any mystery reader, people struggling with alcohol (me), and I personally think those books are awfully written but any fan of fifty shades of grey would enjoy this. Watching the film later.;Book
I typically don't read bestsellers, because I want to give my time to relatively unknown authors who are struggling to get their books into the hands of readers. However, my book club recommended The Girl on the Train and I didn't want to comply so I read it. OMG! I haven't put it down in the last three days and it took me three days only because of work obligations. There are so many reasons why I loved this book. First, technically it is superb! Second, the transition of Rachel is exactly how it should of been stronger, but still flawed. Anna, the one person she hates and desperately doesn't want to have something in common with now shares a forever bond. The book was exceptional! Congratulations to Paula Hawkins!;Book
"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending.";Book
"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it.";Book
Got this book to read before seeing the movie. Loved it!;Book
Two abusive men, three unstable women.. what's to like about it..  much hype some really unlikeable people..;Book
Lots of people like this book. I found the characters unlikable.  The story became tedious.;Book
Both the book and the movie held my interest which is saying something with modern literature.;Book
Read the book before seeing the movie.  The book was a page turner.;Book
Keeps you guessing. A little bit slow in some parts though.  Would recommend to a friend. Great Book overall though.;Book
One of the best books I've read in 2016. I could not stop reading.;Book
Alcohol says it best!!;Book
This was a great read, finished in a couple days as it really kept my attention. It felt a bit obvious but it was still enjoyable.;Book
I recommend everyone read this book.The twist at the end was difficult to see coming.  This is an exceptional novel.;Book
The Girl on the Train asks questions that our society shies away from. How important is it for a woman to be a mother? If someone cheats, who is to blame? Should an alcoholic be trusted and how much is too much?Rachel tries unsuccessfully to put her life together after her marriage crumbles. She rides the train to and from London everyday, caught up in her thoughts and swimming in the aftereffects of a night of drinking. The train always stops at a row of houses, where Rachel sees Jason and Jess living out their romantic lives. Rachel witnesses an argument between Jason and Jess and the next morning Jess is reported missing. Rachel is thrown into the mystery surrounding Jess’ disappearance while clashing with the lives of her ex-husband Tom and his wife Anna.A cast of suspicious characters make an appearance as Rachel works to discover the murderer. Though the killer’s identity is well hidden, the story reads less as a “who done it” and more like a sympathetic narrative of a suffering woman tossed around by circumstances. I identified with the struggle of the three different narrators, their ugliness ringing as true as their virtues. This is a great summer read and will keep you up as you rush to discover the ending. It is definitely worth missing sleep at night!;Book
If you haven't read much up on this book yet, I highly suggest not reading about any of the characters or even a plot summary before reading the book. I think it might take away from some of the elements of the writing that I personally might not have enjoyed otherwise if I had done so. (That said, I mention the main character in the next sentence but it's vague enough to not give anything away.) The main quality I found endearing about this book is the main character, Rachel. She's a hot mess in a dark place and I've definitely had times in my life that felt somewhat similar to that, so it was interesting to see how she handled some very less than comfortable situations. One of the main twists I actually kind of expected so I think that made the book seem a little bit less suspenseful to me, which made this would have been 4 star a 3 star for me.;Book
It was just okay! Maybe because the book was hyped up so much, I expected a lot more. Instead I found it to be a bit shallow in terms of the plot and character development. It wasn't clear why the police kept on jumping from one suspect to another without really having reasonable leads or evidence... and why certain characters were introduced and portrayed the way they were (other than to mislead the reader). It was a quick read though... and worth reading if one is planning to watch the movie.;Book
Will keep this short and sweet - good book, chapters are broken up by character which I found very interesting and unlike most of the books I read. A good portion of the book dives deep into each of the main characters, namely Rachel. In general the book kept my attention and was easy to follow. I do remember the moment I couldn't put the book down - around 80-81% (read on my Kindle). <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A> I don't usually have reactions to books like that and/or find time to read consistently (have 2 kiddos under 3).Have not seen the movie, probably wait until it's avail at home. Have heard from many that it strays from the book (not a big surprise), but what seems so silly is that the book is based in London and suburbs, why is the movie in NY? I love NYC, but come'on!;Book
"I became interested in this book after seeing a preview of a teaser of the movie featuring Emily Blunt which is coming out this year. After doing some research, the summary sounded intriguing and I decided ""Why Not!?"". So glad I did.I couldn't put this book down and read it within two days of its delivery! Even covering my reading light with the comforter so I didn't disturb my parter. He appreciated that, haha.The story is told from different viewpoints, keeping you guessing as to who did what until the end. I've heard it's similar to Gone Girl, which yes, I have yet to read or see the movie...gasp, I know! But, if you like the mystery, who did it book type of storyline, then I recommend checking out this book. Now, just waiting to see how Emily pulls off the lead character.";Book
"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax.";Book
I enjoyed the first three quarters of this book. It was exciting and fast-paced, and I enjoyed being pulled into the main protagonist’s mess of a mind. While she was a wreck and an alcoholic, I still found her sympathetic enough to be likable. One of the themes of the book was that no person or family is perfect, and I think the author did a good job of conveying this. I also enjoyed the buildup as we discover what’s going on with the other woman, Megan, in this story.My disappointment came toward the end. Maybe I’ve read too much fiction, but I didn’t find the twist all that exciting or interesting. Because of this, I did enjoy “Gone Girl” and the awesome use of the unreliable narrator a lot more. Given all the positive reviews, it seemed like “Girl on the Train” was going to lead up to something really unique. Given the deteriorating mental state of the protagonist, I was preparing myself for something along the lines of multiple personality disorder or finding out a character wasn’t real. (Not that those devices are completely unique—but I was still waiting for something kind of off the wall) Instead, it just becomes a terrifying domestic dispute. The men in this story are also very unlikable and needed a few more redeeming qualities.I’d recommend it for a fun summer poolside read but don’t expect too much.;Book
The story starts of from the viewpoint of a woman so depressed and in such psychic pain that she regularly drinks herself into oblivion. She lost her husband, her job , rents a small bedroom from a friend, and  pretends  to take the train to work each day and sees  the back of houses on her old street as she goes into London.  She daydreams about a  couple a few doors down from where she used to live  and she occasionally  sees one or both of them and others as the train passes.  She imagines their life together as perfect and as what she had so longed for.  She is so devastated about being left for another woman who had her ex-husband's baby and she feels so sad that she lost him and agrees with him that she was to blame.  The sad part is, she had  been systematically taken apart, her pride, her will , her sense of self , by  a sociopath who enjoys seducing, controlling, and then draining women of any sense of worth and when he succeeds, abandons them as they are unworthy.  Some tiny little glimmer in her peeks out  and she ends up intervening in the life of the husband of the young couple  when  the wife disappears and the husband  is a suspect (and she has seen another man with the wife).  Very difficult to read and harder to put down and, while true to itself, nothing is as it seems.  Psychological thrillers are not my favorite, this was recommended by a friend, and was compelling.;Book
"""Twice a day, I am offered a view into other lives, just for a moment. There’s something comforting about the sight of strangers safe at home.”Rachel Watson rides the train to and from London every weekday. The train stops at the same faulty signal, near where Rachel use to live with her then-husband, Tom. While waiting at the signal, she looks into her favorite track-side house, hoping to see the man and woman who live there. Although Rachel doesn't know them, she calls them Jess and Jason. Rachel has woven a fantasy about them, and they have the perfect life. Except they don’t.Desperately unhappy, Rachel has developed a drinking problem. She is unable to accept that Tom has remarried and lives with his new wife and their baby in the house he shared with Rachel. Rachel has made a nuisance of herself to the point of harassment--calling Tom repeatedly and stopping by to see him, especially after she’s been drinking.What Rachel sees from the train one day will compel her to insert herself into Jess and Jason’s lives and put her own in danger.This story was quick-paced and hard to put down. Although I cringed at some of the things Rachel did, her character was so well-developed, I could sympathize with her. The Girl on the Train is an excellent debut novel, and I can’t wait for more from this author. I highly recommend this book for readers who like a taut, well-written psychological thriller.";Book
"This is not a good book. The ""twist"" was obvious early on and not much of a surprise. What is with these female novelists who write these absolutely pitiful female characters who are so dependent on a man and popping out babies to give them social status that they are utterly broken and inoperable without these things. BOO!";Book
This book started off slow for me.  And I thought a little confusing.  I kept getting bored and putting the book down.  I also didn't like the main character.  Then about midway the whole tenor of the story changed.  But I still couldn't get in to it.  Then, bam, near the end the story picked up speed and turned very intense.  And I still didn't care what happened to the characters!I like a good mystery but this one was convoluted with unsympathetic characters.  I was sorry I wasted my time.;Book
3.5 stars actually. I was a fan of Gone Girl and this book is structured similarly. The first half was really suspenseful but, just like with Gone Girl, I figured out about half way through who the real villain was. That takes some of the suspense and enjoyment out of the reading. Another issue I had  is that the entire narrative depends on the main character's frequent and complete alcoholic blackouts. Now granted I don't know much about alcoholic blackouts but they seemed a bit too convenient in terms of the narrative. In fact, without them, the entire plot wouldn't exist. So, in summary, if you liked Gone Girl you'll probably like this one just don't expect to be too surprised when the killer is revealed.;Book
"I read the reviews prior to buying, and I assumed I wouldn't be able to put it down, as many other reviewers stated. Actually, the opposite happened. I just wasn't too interested nor involved in this book. It took me a while to finish, which is a disappointment for me. I kept reading, hoping that it would get better, and it just didn't for me. Sure, the story offers some twists and turns, but it was just too slow. My life is not changed after reading it, as I like for it to be after reading a great book. Other reviewers say it is similar to ""Gone Girl,"" and was recommended to me after I read ""The Kind Worth Killing,"" both books in which I gave 5 star ratings to. This book is a shame compared to those. It just did not keep me intrigued.";Book
"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author.";Book
A fast moving story involving several people. Those being Rachel (The Girl on the train) Tom her ex husband Annie his current wife, Megan the woman who goes missing and Scott,  Megan's husband. Of course also members of the Constabulary . When Rachel was married to Tom she was not able to bear children and eventually she became more fond of the bottle than anything else. This quite often led her to have trouble recognising what was real and what was a dream. The story is narrated by the 3 women and explains to you what was going on with their lives. So long as you don't mind a bit of foul language the story is quite gripping and even though it is of fiction what happens probably happens a lot more than we realise.Well worth a read.;Book
"Well, thanks to Joe Hill my interest in reading has reached a high I haven't reached since 5th grade, when I read classic, Elementary books such as ""Holes"", ""Where the Red Fern Grows"", and some other titles I can't pull out of my ass right now.Joe Hill's books created a reading monster, and before I even finished ""NOS4A2"" I order Paula Hawkin's, ""The Girl on the Train"", a first person narrative about an alcoholic, divorced lady, Rachel, who's black-out antics may or may not have lead her to kill a blonde whom most likely reminds her of Anna, the woman who Rachel's husband left her for. In contrast to the tremendous, fantasy, 3rd person writing of Joe Hill, ""The Girl on The Train"", is rather straight foreword.This doesn't make ""The Girl on the Train"" bad, I love the book! Read it, it's a really quick read and it puts its reader in the shoes of multiple characters with a clever-ease that isn't confusing like I've found some other novels to be. But...if you're picking this book up after reading possibly one of the best books of your life, prepare to plateau in dissapointment.In vulgar terms, it's like if you dated a guy with a ten incher and you both break up, then get with a guy who's like 7 and a half inches. See the new guy is big, but he's not a porn star, and that makes your downstairs mixup, quite sad.";Book
"The book departs from a good premise. Rachel, a conflicted woman (not a girl by any chance) spying on her former husbands new wife and some neighbors which houses rest in the path of the train that she takes every morning to work. Or to pretend she works. She's a full blown alcoholic drifting on a world of fantasy.Cleverly, Hawkins jumps from her point of view, narrated as a diary of sorts, to the view the three women in the novel. The observed neighbor, Megan, who has a complicated life and demeanor far from Rachel imagination. And Anna, her former husband's new wife.The conflicting POV work fine for a while, until half the book. There it stumbles a bit with contrived twists. Perhaps the weaker point of the novel (spoilers aside) is that in many ways pretends to be a whodunit, with a very small pool of suspects. The best point is the characterization of the women (all of them, even Rachel's roommate, poor old good-sport Claire; exception noted for non convincing detective Riley), and the misogynous dark world they inhabit, where beyond roleplaying as companions, mothers, wives, lovers, sinners or victims, there's not much left for them to aspire.Good first fiction effort by Hawkins.";Book
"This story got my attention from the first page and I truly enjoyed the whole ride. When writing this review, I was trying to find something that I didn't like about it,to be fair, but couldn’t find anything and this is what my 5 star rating shows.The plot basically revolves around Rachel, who takes the same commuter train every day and suddenly sees something rather than usual, that changes her life for ever. This particularly event and a few mental-life crisis moments will make Rachel figure out that what is in front of you, sometimes is not always what it seems to be.It is told through the voice of three different women, which gives the narrative a more clear insight and adds mystery to the story.I have read Gone Girl before and I can say is one of my favorite thrillers of all time.I thought I was hardly ever gonna have the opportunity to read something similar to it, but let me tell you, I did and it was thanks to Paula Hawkins.There were sometimes that I couldn't believe what I was reading, it has an original  storyline that keeps your hearth pounding, gripping and wanting for more. I totally recommend it.Favorite Quotes:- “Life is not a paragraph, and death is no parenthesis.”-“I have never understood how people can blithely disregard the damage they do by following their hearts.”- “It's  possible to miss what you’ve never had, to mourn for it.”-“The holes in your life are permanent. You have to grow around them, like tree roots around concrete; you mould yourself through the gaps.”-“I’ve been the fool. If he does it with you, he’ll do it to you.”";Book
This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!;Book
"As appears on Goodreads.com I finished this on St. Paddy's Day and I'm still torn between 3 and 4 Stars. Author, Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite ALL of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson's ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She's a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she's just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she's dubbed ""Jess and Jason."" She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real ""Jess"" - Meagan - shows us. Tom's current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom's ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman's situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she's invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women's altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I've said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in ""Rear Window."" Something bad has happened and we know it's coming and we can't shut our eyes. We readers must know what happened and by whose hands.";Book
Wow...this book had many twists and turns...really enjoyed it..there were times when I could not put the book down..Great Read;Book
I only wish she diddnt end up alone... And that the girls would have stayed friends, and that the guy would have suffered more.;Book
Ugh....it took everything in me to even get to page 50, at which time I skimmed quickly to the end and wasn't impressed at all.  If you like Gone Girl then you'll like this.  I liked neither.;Book
So well written, such a twist! I usually figure out rather quickly who did it but this one kept me guessing! A must read!;Book
It was an interesting way to read a book, from several points of view. I kept wondering how it was all going to pull together.;Book
Better than the movie;Book
I can't decide if I really liked this book or not. I kept reading just to find out the who and why, but found it hard to like any of the people.;Book
Confusing at times in the beginning and then frustrating at other times. Keeps you off balance and eventually you can't put it down.;Book
Great read!;Book
It was alright. TBH I don't understand all the hype about it, but it was a pleasant enough read. I wanted to scream at the heroine throughout pretty much the whole book. I think my biggest problem with the book was that I didn't actually like any of the characters in it, not even a supporting character. I found it hard to connect with the story because of that.;Book
It kept me reading wanting to know what would happen next! A good mystery with a little twist.;Book
Great read;Book
I could not stop reading this book! The characters felt so real. It is a must read! Highly recommended! :);Book
It think I was expecting a lot more going into it. It wasn't terrible but it was a little too dramatic for my taste.;Book
LOVED it!;Book
I'm not usually into mystery/thrillers but this was very entertaining! It is a little slow to start but it makes up for it later. Just read it.;Book
Loved loved loved this book.;Book
great book;Book
Quick read. Suspenseful till the end. I enjoyed it up until the very end. Surprise ending that I never saw coming.;Book
The Girl On the Train was a really good read. Kept me guessing until the end. The author really captures the voice of the main characters. Great job.;Book
Boring!;Book
I liked the story, but wasn't thrilled.;Book
This book builds on events slowly but keeps the reader engaged all the way to the end. I would recommend this to all my reading friends!;Book
"The book's opening chapters grabbed and held my interest. Then my interest began waning and quickly was transformed to annoyance, impatience, outright irritation and finally, full-blown dislike. I ended up really disliking this book. I thought the plot was so implausible and contrived - and, of course, many suspense/mystery novels are implausible and contrived, but this is yet another one of the type that has no foot in reality - as to be unacceptable. It veered into absurdity. More than that, however, was my increasingly intense dislike for all of the characters - every single one of them, but probably most of all, the main character, Rachel. I found her alcoholism, her black-outs, her laxity, her passivity, her strange behavior even outside of her alcoholic binges, everything about her just repugnant. But that was true of every character for different reasons and to varying degrees of dislike. The stylistic technique of alternating ""voices"" was OK and the different female characters represented in those voices were fairly well distinguished, enough so as to follow ""their chapters.""  One thing that I did appreciate, and it stands on contrast to ""Gone Girl"", was the absence of detailed, specific, ""graphic"" sexual material. There were indirect references but we weren't forced into the beds, bodies and minds of people in sexual encounters - and I appreciated that!  I didn't find any obvious type or similar types of editing errors, also appreciated. I thought the basic style and quality of writing was OK, outside of plot. Character development was OK, but they were just so thoroughly unlikeable and unlikely, in my opinion.2016 has been a year that for me, as an enthusiastic reader, has been a year in which I have learned to distrust blurbs, critics, and reviews in general.  I have read too many books this year that were glowingly reviewed, best-selling, even award nominees - and yet left me thinking:  where have all the great novels gone? Do I have to return to beloved books of the past and re-read?Apparently plenty of people like this book a lot. I'm not one of them.";Book
Very suspenseful. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and engulf you the entire time. One of my new favorites.;Book
I got a chance to read over a 3day Christmas break.I didn't put it down.A must read before they make the movie;Book
Fantastic book! A page turner for sure!;Book
It was a fun read. I enjoyed the main character and could identify with her struggles and pain. She was very real;Book
It's a hard one to ever put day;Book
Good Read;Book
Didn't like the characters, and found the plot very predictable.;Book
It took me 50 pages before I understand what was going on and that there were actually three different people's point of view. Once that happened the book was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat all the way to the end. The only reason I gave it four stars and not five was because there were too many spelling errors. Being an English major, this drives me crazy. If you need someone to proofread your book, let me know. I'm free;Book
Starts as a chick flick, then shows out as down and dirty drama.so different from other normal style of explaining real life.just buy it.;Book
Good book.;Book
The story line was too slow until the end when the story was reaching it's conclusion.  I lost sympathy with the main character as her behavior got boring and unrealistic.;Book
As good as Gone Girl. I could not stop reading and finished in one day.;Book
when you need something new to read, this book might be interesting;Book
Would have been a five if they didn't talk like sailors.;Book
Suspense that never let's up and keeps you turning the pages.;Book
A page turner! I couldn't put this book down! Sitting at the edge of my seat! I'm sad it's over, I hope a second book will come out!!!;Book
"I very much enjoyed this book. It was nearing the end before I figured everything out, and although there were some reveals I had not seen coming, nothing was out of sync with the portrayal of the characters. It was all one of those ""oh, that makes sense now"". With the back-and-forth chapters between characters and time, I would have done better with a hard copy of the book as opposed to the Kindle version as I couldn't remember the dates/times well enough without needing to look back (which is too much of a pain on Kindle for me to mess with). However, once each chapter started, it was pretty easy to keep up with whether the timeline was past or present so it wasn't a problem and made the story more intriguing than if were told straightforward. There were moments of suspense, but for me it was more thoughtful as I tried to work through what each character had been through, what they were feeling, the struggle with their past and their present, and how it affected their actions along the way as the book built up to ""what really happened"". I will read this one again.";Book
"This book is appropriately titled because it's like watching a train wreck - you simply can't look away. Mesmerized from the beginning, I could not put the book down until I was finished. I HAD to know the end.One review I read called it ""Hitchcockian"" and I could not agree more. It reminded me of the movie Rear Window. Told from three different women's points of view, The Girl On The Train is a suspense thriller at it's finest.I am a character driven reader and writer and the characters in this book are written brilliantly. Rachel is a literal train wreck herself but the author wrote her in such a way that I felt sorry enough for her to want to know her story. And I really wanted things to work out for her. The other characters were so full of mystery and intrigue I felt unease about each one, never truly knowing them or what they would do next.And I loved how the book ended. The author didn't leave the reader with frustrating unknowns but wraps it up in a way where I was satisfied but can't stop thinking about the story. Brilliant. Excellent read.";Book
I'm flabbergasted by the rave reviews, especially that there are 17,500+ mostly positive reviews. At the 20% mark, I debated ending the boredom since nothing had happened yet. Once I got to about 50%, I was still bored and confused about what all the fuss what about because still nothing much had happened. But I slogged through and finished, and I'm still shaking my head. Not one of the seven main characters is likable. Most of them drink heavily. The pacing is slow and repetitive. The book felt so amateurish that I really question what has happened to the reading public that books like this and Gone Girl, another poorly written and over-hyped mess, are so popular. Are books with fully developed characters and carefully crafted plots too challenging for people? I just don't get it.;Book
What a waste of time.  This book is getting lots of attention while it should be ignored.  I should have put it down when 4D (Drunk, Depressed, Ditzy, Destructive) protagonist continues haranguing the ex-husband.  This one is hard to stomach, 4D has no clue as to her ex's character?  She goes to work for months after being fired? 4D can't remember what she did while drinking but later in the book does.  The only cheat the author didn't succumb to is magic.;Book
Rachel rides the train every day past her old neighborhood and feels regret for the life she used to have.  She sees the new neighbors and imagines the life they're living.  Somehow she gets involved when the woman she's been watching goes missing, but Rachel is a raging drunk and her memory is sketchy at best.This felt like it took forever to read, none of the characters were likeable,.  However, I did learn that gin and tonic is available in a can, so there you go.;Book
Meh.  I wasn't very impressed.  While the story line was okay, I felt that it was predictable.  I think all the hype set me up for disappointment.  I felt that a lot of things were repeated, and grew tired of reading the same types of details used to describe the characters.  I thought it was interesting when the author went into detail about alcohol induced blackouts, but once again, mentioned it so many times, which played a part in the predictability.  The way the story wrapped up was especially jarring and disappointing.  it was unrealistic, and again, contributed to it's predictability.  its a short and somewhat enjoyable read, and many people enjoy it.  If you're looking for a book to jolt your senses, push buttons, or affect your emotions in any way, this book is not for you.;Book
This novel was a page turner for me.  I hated putting it down.  However, none of the characters is likeable and they are all rather depressing.  That doesn't bother me, as I like novels that have interesting character development.  I did think most of the characters and many of the events were unrealistic and over the top, but that is true of many novels. Think of science fiction and fantasy novels, for example.Rachel, the main character was an alcoholic and I kept hoping she would straighten up and quit drinking.  Much of the time I just wanted to shake her for making repeated poor decisions.  Her ex-husband Tom had left her for Anna.  They had a baby, something Rachel had not been able to do.  Anna and Tom seemed to be happy, but then he was cheating with Megan whom he hired to be a babysitter.  The story is told in alternating chapters by these three women.As I said, the novel kept me reading and wanting to know what would happen next.  I kept trying to figure out who was a reliable narrator and who committed the murder.  It was well written too. I guessed who the murderer was after reading about 80% of the book, but I occasionally thought I might be wrong.Even though I liked it a lot, it is not a book that I'm likely to remember a few years from now, perhaps because several of the situations seemed contrived.;Book
A got drawn into this book as much for the story about the dark journey of an alcoholic hitting bottom as for the tale of whodunnit.  I felt the author was quite good at detailing with accuracy and nuance the bizarre, guilt ridden, unreasonable inner world of a woman lost in blackout drinking.  The main character is pathetic, but she is sympathetic enough that I found her ultimately heroic.The author adeptly crafted a whodunnit tale with enough twists and turns, weaving a web of storylines with just enough believability that kept me guessing long enough.The authors strength was her keen understanding of the human mind at it's darker limits, reminding me a bit of what I loved so much about Crime and Punishment.;Book
I couldn't wait for this book to be over. I purchased it because it was on the 'recommended' list if you had enjoyed A. Doerr's exquisite novel  All the Light We Cannot See...which is on my top 10 forever list. It is unfathomable to determine the logic used to couple it with Doerr's masterpiece, but I assume this is why Hawkin's book has sold so well.There was not one character with whom to develop a  hopeful compassion (key ingredient) and draw you in intimately. I hung in and kept reading The Girl on the Train thinking Hawkins would somehow pull it off but alas...the depressing story  laid itself flat all the way to it's merciful conclusion.  Save your money. Pick up Lady in Gold and All the Light we Cannot see and sink into something you wish had no last page.;Book
Rachel is fat.  Fat fat Rachel.  Rachel drinks.  Drinks, Rachel, drink.  Rachel is unlikable.  Poor, poor Rachel.  Add in ex-husband Tom, who is shown to have about as much personality as paste.  New wife Anna, who slept with Tom while he was married to Rachel, and seems to exist primarily to whine about Fat Rachel (and Anna can't seem to think of Rachel without saying that she's Fat).  Scott, who sleeps with Rachel even though she's Fat and his wife has been murdered, and Megan, the murdered wife who has a history, but again no personality.  And finally, Rachel's roommate who exists solely to complain about Rachel's drinking.Dull.  Tedious.  You don't care about any of the characters.  And you can't really guess who dunnit as there are so few clues.Ah, well, if cured my insomnia for a while.;Book
It took me a bit to get invested in this book, but once I did I was hooked. The premise is basically a woman, who is an alcoholic rides a train every day and passes a house where a couple live, and makes up names and a happy, perfect life for them, and then one day something happens. That's about as much as I got from the blurb, and as I didn't read any other reviews, it took me awhile to figure out how this could even be interesting. However, there is much more to this story. The author fills in the plot holes slowly, and through different perspectives, but it all comes together. There's a twist at the end I began suspecting, but then when it came it was still gratifyingly good. The main character, Rachel, is pretty frustrating, but it's nice that she gets her, for lack of a better word-balls about her there at the end. They're making a movie of this with Emily Blunt and I'm very excited to see that adaptation as well. Great read.;Book
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.;Book
Read from November 29 to December 01, 2015 I can't really write a review because I think I'm lost somewhere in the book. Paula Hawkins has a vivid imagination and a talent for sharing it with us in the form of a book. There needs to be 'other' characters besides the 'main' characters, and there are. But I found myself getting ahead of the writer with my own assumptions and a couple of characters are left scratching their heads and squinting their eyes wondering when there turn will come or that's how I see them.I wanted to be surprised in the end and I wasn't. I was even a little disappointed, but that could be my own vivid imagination getting in the way. I may even go back and read the last few chapters to see what I may have missed.4 stars for The Girl on the Train. I really did like it. I liked the concept of the part the train played in it all, a very good character by the way. I do recommend the book. Maybe someone can fill in some of the gaps for me. (less);Book
"I found the character of Rachel to be quite enjoyable, just because she's so difficult to like. In fact, all the characters in this book are difficult to like. They're all flawed. They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess. But oh well, such is life.";Book
"""Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning. Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She's even started to feel like she knows them. ""Jess and Jason,"" she calls them. Their life - as she sees it - is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking. It's only a minute until the train moves on, but it's enough. Now everything's changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good?""I found ""The Girl on the Train"" by Paula Hawkins hard to put down; it's definitely a page turner with many quirks. I've read that Hawkins is being compared to Gillian Flynn which is difficult as this is Hawkins' debut novel, but I'm hoping Hawkins continues in this genre.I enjoyed the way that Hawkins draws you in, the way that you think you know what is happening; but as the story unfolds you start to question Rachel and her judgement. I did realise whodunnit, but this didn't detract from the novel (as I was near the end) but it was the circumstances and the characters who were the true ""twist"".Four and a half stars - I look forward to Hawkins next novel.";Book
This book is told from three different perspectives: Rachel is an alcoholic who rides the train to and from London every day, watching the houses and imagining the peoples’ lives. Megan is one of those people, and she spends every day fighting within her own head about what to do — does she still likes her husband, or should she run away? Anna is the new wife of Tom, Rachel’s ex-husband. They live in Rachel’s old house with their baby girl, Evie. Rachel, depressed with how her life has turned out, spends her days drinking, usually ending with making a rude, drunken call to Tom.One day, Rachel sees Megan’s face in the news — she’s gone missing. Rachel has to battle her blackouts — she knows she saw something important, but she can’t remember. She knows she has to help.This book, widely regarded as the next “Gone Girl,” is a psychological thriller. It’s a strange feeling, as a reader, when the main character is such an unlikeable woman who is unwilling to help herself. However, with more and more information, more revelations, you begin to see why she is how she is. She has to fight for herself, for people to believe her, to have purpose in the world. “The Girl on the Train” is a solid thriller and I will definitely be reading any future books from Paula Hawkins.;Book
"I didn't really sense any ""suspense"" in this novel until I reached the half way point. I was annoyed with keeping track of chapters with dates, and there are three different female voices which makes this a difficult type of book to read on a Kindle. I almost quit half way through the book because I just didn't like anyone in the story. However, I'm glad I finished it because the author did eventually bring the story to a satisfying conclusion. I have read reviews that compare it to Gone Girl and it doesn't rise to that level at all. I think I would have edited out half the alcoholic stupors for Rachel because I just got tired of her reasons and excuses for being how she was. The book is simply Okay.";Book
"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It was a page turning psychological thriller that was hard to put down and can easily finished in a day or afternoon of reading.  The main character, Rachel, is somewhat of a sad case that has not gotten over her failed marriage to Tom, who has moved on with another woman, Anna and recently had a child (something she was unable to give him).  As if the divorce and her inability to have children is not enough, Rachel is constantly reminded of Tom’s new life without her every day as she passes by their home that was once hers on the train each day.  She is obsessed with them and their neighbor Megan and her husband.  The story is told from the perspective of the three women; Rachel, Anna and Megan.  As Rachel’s life continues to disintegrate throughout the novel, her obsession with the couples along with her drinking problem continues to get worse.  As her life falls apart, she becomes engrossed with Megan’s disappearance and trying to solve what happened to her.  With the three perspective stories the reader is left trying to figure out what eventually happens to Megan upon her disappearance and how all three women are connected.  The climax and ending of the book is truly shocking and will leave you wanting more from Paula Hawkins.  The plot would make an excellent movie and I am looking forward to more work from this author.";Book
"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read.";Book
"I have not been intrigued by a new novel, in quite some time, as I have a habit of sticking to my favourite authors.  When I read the premise for 'The Girl on the Train', I was so curious and excited, I immediately bought a copy of the novel.In short, I liked the book....but I did not love it.  I enjoyed the diary format, the 3 person point of view, and I even thought that it was very interesting and refreshing that the author made each of the characters quite unsavoury and almost un-likeable.  What caused me to rate this story less than a perfect 5 stars is that, although it was very readable, it seemed that certain scenes were repetitious, especially noticeable with Rachel.  And... Although the ending was good, it just seemed anticlimactic.I am also quite curious about what this author does next and how ""The Girl on the Train"" translates to film.";Book
Gripping and compelling the whole time. Unpredictable twists and drama throughout the book. I can't wait to see the movie.;Book
definitely not for me, not for man;Book
What an amazing story!  I literally did not take a break from beginning to end.  So many plot twists and turns!  Awesome!;Book
A riveting mystery. Don't try to watch tv while reading this or you will be confused.;Book
Entertaining and quick read. However, if you are a law and order junkie like myself, a bit predictable.  Good beach read.;Book
Wow,  I couldn't put it down.  Rachel's voice  is so real my heart ached for her.  A page turner to the very end.;Book
Great suspense!;Book
My first read by this author. Good writing and she definitely pulls you in. The book keeps twisting right to the end.;Book
This book just grabs you! Could not put down. Had me thinking about it for days after I finished the book.;Book
A great novel with many twists. It will keep your attention right to the great ending. It was hard to put down.;Book
"This book  had me enthralled from the start , the ""heroine"" of the book evoked feelings of sympathy as she stumbled through her life , a victim of a cruel  heartbreak  which leaves her as a pitiful victim , though it is easy to understand her despair and feel for her as she weaves her fantasy to distract and escape from the hopelessness and unfairness  of her situation .  This is a compelling thriller and I really couldn't put it down. Was the conclusion as twisted and clever as I would have hoped? I can't say it left me with a big ""wow"" factor as I would have liked but still a satisfying conclusion. I like the way the 3 female characters were involved in the storytelling and like all good books I became emotionaly involved in some way with each character .  Defiantly a good read I recommend it.";Book
"...then read this book. Otherwise, skip it. I promise. One day, I will find the person who took the bribe cash to get this $16 cinder block onto the NY Times Bestseller List, and I will not allow them to get away from me until they are able to recite the definitions for ""Hitchcockian"" and ""psychological thriller"" from memory.The writing is stilted, the timeline is funky, the flat characters are pancake flat, and the main and round characters are written just well enough to keep you from beating your face in with whatever vehicle is carrying this work to your unfortunate retinas. If anything, this book made me wonder what type of activities the author had time to engage in while writing it, because she clearly wasn't working on any kind of character or plot development.";Book
I finished this book a few days ago after several people at work started reading it and saying how good it was, so I of course had to read it. But whoa was I not prepared for my mind being blown and all over the place with the writing style. I enjoy a book that gives point of view from different people don't get me wrong,but when there is so much switching back and forth and with dates involved it becomes too much. And once I finished I sat there for a good 5 minutes still in shock, because of who did it and my unanswered questions. Overall I would say I liked it, but it won't be a book I would read again, it took me well over half the book just to get into it like everyone else did. But it's worth a read, and four stars.;Book
The Girl on the Train had my attention at times, other times I felt like I was just trying to get to the end. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced, jobless, alcoholic. She shows up at her old house (which is now being lived in by her ex, his new wife and their daughter) and doesn't remember it the next day as she suffers from alcoholic amnesia. She makes up a pretend life for the people that live a few doors down from her old house as she passes them by everyday as she pretends to go to work. She then learns the woman in said house is now missing. She was in the area that night but cannot remember anything because of a blackout. The story then goes on with Rachel trying to fill in the missing pieces that night.This story is told from three different pov. We have Rachel, the amnesiac alcoholic, Anne, the mistress and now wife of Rachel's ex, and Megan, the now missing woman with a lot of secrets. Most of the characters in this book are rather bleak. The only one I found likeable was Rachel's roomate. I think she may be the only sane one in the bunch. This book could be redundant at times with Rachel always drinking but never remember what happened. But she somehow found her way home each time.I give it three stars because it was an okay read. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends but if you can't find anything to read this book can pass the time.;Book
This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book.;Book
"The movie, primarily because of Emily Blunt's acting, is much better than the novel.  Emily Blunt kept my interest.  The novel took way too long to get moving so that I was ""ho hum"" when are we going to get on with what's actually happening here. I gave the movie three stars because Blunt's five star performance averaged out the ho hum tediousness of the novel's story line.  I can't for the life of me figure out why the novel became such best seller.";Book
I have no problem tossing a book to the side after a couple of chapters if I don't like it. This one I wanted to throw across the room! I just can't understand the good reviews, but I had to keep reading to see if I could figure it out. I never did.I tried skimming once I got halfway through, but it wasn't easy. The book is told from the point of view of different characters but they all sound the same. Not to worry, you know you're reading about the main character if she is constantly worried about her next drink.This trend of going back and forth, writing chapters from the perspective of different characters and at different times (which she also does) can be the mark of a lazy writer. It takes time to create a single narrator, and I don't think this writer had the skill.;Book
I loved  this book I read it twice which I have never done before. if you were a heavy drinker or if you knew one in your life you will relate to Rachel, who is the main character in this book. the beginning was hard to follow for me. the book is told in three characters Rachel, megan, and anna. who by the way are all connected in  some way which you find out as you get to know these people. Rachel gives a lot of misinformation thru out the book aka blackouts dreams ect. related to her being an alcoholic which adds a Hitchcock feel to this story. it is a mystery novel . the book is slow in the beginning till you get to know who megan and anna  are, but hold on the book takes off like a running train lots of twists in this. Rachel was awesome throughout the whole book and the ending is awesome  I can't get Rachel out of my head!!! without giving anything away you will have a different perspective for Rachel and be amazed of what she can do in a crisis.  I hope there is sequel;Book
"This was a book I could not put down.That being said, in some ways, many ways in fact, it reminded me too much of Gone Girl.Perhaps this is the London version of Gone Girl.Girl on the Train is fast-paced, riveting and engrossing.I could not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!";Book
I heard this book being hyped as the next Gone Girl, but it definitely isn't.  It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but I just felt like the story was sloppy... Maybe because Rachel was so sloppy with her drinking and her behavior (and in turn her narration) but it's hard to get behind a character that is so non like-able.  Maybe if there had been more telling about her relationship with Tom in the beginning, so you are able to develop some sympathy for her before you meet her as a black out drunk.  I don't know.*SPOILERS*All that aside, I did spend the whole book trying to formulate who I thought was the culprit, and at one point I was thinking that it could have been Rachel that killed Megan so obviously the plot was well written and spun together.  I had suspicions early on about what was going on with Megan and I was right about those assumptions, but did not expect the end with Anna.So overall, a good read that kept my interest... the comparisons to Gone Girl though really set it up to disappoint some readers I think though.;Book
Truly keeps you guessing to the very end! I read this in 3 days, very surprising. Can't wait for the film.;Book
I couldn't put the book down! There were twist and turns on each page. Never would have guessed who the killer is;Book
I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.;Book

Both my mother and I read and enjoyed the story.  Look forward to reading another book by this author soon.;Book
Started a bit slow and the middle was a bit boring and confusing towards the middle. Was shocked by the ending.;Book

Excellent book.  Look forward to seeing the movie.;Book
What a thriller. The book makes you think you know- until you don't! Great read. Can't wait to see the movie.;Book
The main character was an alcoholic and  consequently she couldn't remember or justify her behavior.  Plot was confusing and weak.;Book
Good start, somewhat slow in the middle but an really unexpected ending!!! Wow!!!;Book
A quick, intense and insane romp through the lives of a few folks who you know could be your neighbors...despite your hope that they are not.;Book
Anyone that likes multiple viewpoints of the same scene this book is for you. Intrigue, suspense, murder, and lust make this book intense and believable.;Book
Fantastic book. Haven't seen the film but the book was great;Book
Loved this book...it keeps interests and moves very well. one if those hard to out down books.;Book
I enjoyed this book. I liked the character development. I did have to go back from time to time to see which character I was reading about and the story was choppy at times but I loved the final chapters and couldn't put it down since I just had to know what was going to happen. I liked the premise of someone on a train fantasizing about the lives of the people they watch daily from a train window. I hope to read more from this author.;Book
Overall liked the book - but it is not something I would re-visit as (1) There is not too much sub-text or character details that I want to re-visit after the reveal and  **spoilers ahead**(2) though there is some attempt at describing and analyzing issues related to infertility, baby death, alcoholism, the author does not dig too deeply to surface the complexity around them. For e.g. it would have been great to know more about the killer - not the motivation, which was clearly laid out, but just more about the killer's tastes, personality, etc.The multiple narrator touch seems to be a new thing in literature, especially the unreliable-female-narrator. It works for a larger extent, but of course, I can sense the struggle that the author might go through with trying not to reveal too many spoilers.Recommended for its good premise and pace. Made some difficult reading for me as some of the issues mentioned drove home.;Book
Except with Hitchcock I haven't read a compelling book that gives the reader a separate scene that allows complete third person omniscient perspective. On this train Rachel rides daily into London to a job she lost months ago. Her perspective out of the train window and when the train stops she can peek into the homes and lives of two separate families. On the train back to her flat, she often begins drinking canned gin and tonics that eventually lead to her alcoholic black outs. She is obsessive about her lost life with her ex-husband, her infertility and a mystical couple who live a few doors down from her previous home.Not only does Rachel observe the back terraces, but she notices clothes and oddities that are discarded by the train tracks below her.As the story unfolds, Hawkins develops each character into deeper, darker aspects of what we first know. Rachel is written to be dark from the beginning, however what the reader doesn't expect is the other characters are equally complex and dark.I highly recommend this book. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the editing, e.g., misspelled words, incorrect word choice (then versus than). That flaw was distracting, but not so much as I didn't finish the book.;Book
Warning: This is not a happy book. It takes place in a suburb of London and is full of broken people living broken lives. However, how these broken people are revealed and how they all relate to a murder is what makes the book interesting. The mystery is told from three different women’s points of view, each telling their story in the first person. It can get little confusing, especially when they jumble time periods, but you slowly learn the whole story by listening to each one. I was intrigued in the first third, bored somewhat by Rachel’s interminable alcohol black-outs in the middle, but then was gripped through the final third as the full truth began to be revealed. It has almost no action (until the end) and is mostly a lot of sad people talking about their sad lives, but the way the author broke up this murder mystery made it interesting. Kind of how I feel about the romance in the movie “500 Days of Summer” where the story is pretty simple but the reveal is the fascinating part. So I enjoyed it, but don’t read it if you need a lift of your spirits! 3-1/2 stars out of 5.;Book
This book was ok. The blackouts of the main character seem a stretch, especially toward the end of the book. While I like the premise of the story unfolding through different character voices, the development of each character is shallow. You know each of the characters has demeaning, undesirable qualities, but they are just blah and predictable. The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed. I wouldnt say the book was a total wash, but I fail to understand the rave reviews.;Book
I read the reviews on this book. People comparing it to Gone Girl and such. Well I thought the book was pretty good, but it was no Gone Girl.The main character is hard to like. She exudes self pity and naïveté to a degree that sometimes makes you roll your eyes. I get it. Things are hard and she is confused. We've all probably felt that way. It's just ... Well I wasn't against her but I wasn't exactly cheering for her either.There is a neat little twist near the end of this book that did surprise me and ultimately I was satisfied at the ending.This book is good beach reading. I wouldn't call it riveting and it is easy to feel depressed as the story unfolds and you get caught up in the messes of these peoples' lives. But it's interesting enough to slog through to the end. I was glad to be done with it though.;Book
I originally wrote a very short review complaining that the author lifted the idea of her book from Agatha Crhistie.I'm editing this now because I think readers need to know some specific negatives about this, especially in the Kindle edition.About the novel: This is sort of a psychological mystery. It provides great suspense until midway, then it falls flat.  We think we have a complex, scary kind of lady on this train and that she is up to no good. In fact, the plot of the story is way less interesting and the mysterious crackpot isn't.I don't know why Hawkins uses triple narration. It does not move the story forward, in fact, the story doesn't know what direction it's going with this style narration. I kept saying, okay, when is this taking place, and thinking I have a chronology when I don't.Reading this in Kindle is excruciating. In a book, I'd be flipping pages backwards to check on who said what, when, and in regard to whom. With Kindle, you can only Go To a location or a page and Lord knows how you figure that out from the Table of Contents.If you think you'd like to read this, for godssakes don't buy it for Kindle.;Book
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.;Book
Yes, it is similar to Gone Girl, but Gone Girl is much better.The Girl on a Train starts amazingly and is seductive at the beginning, but at the third of it, starts losing its power. The story is narrated by three women and you cannot distinguish their voices. All of them describe, tell and narrate exactly in the same way, so it's like they don't have a personality of their own. At some point the descriptions are a little boring, and the action is missing.In summary, it starts great, then it falls, but the ending is fine. It actually makes a clear feminist statement. The topics that you can analyze from the book are many and they are relevant, the idea is ver good, but something is missing.;Book
This author certainly knows how to weave a sad tale of loneliness, sadness and how one person's selfish, evil acts can affect the lives of so many others. This book is definetly a page turner. After a certain point I knew who the killer was, but did not expect the person who steps up in the end to do so. The story line does keep your interest, but I had to put it down every few chapters and take a break from the main character's sadness. To me that speaks of the author's ability to absorb you into her words. I gave this book 4 stars because, even though it is well written and certainly worth reading, I do not have any interest in reading it again, I only rate books I would re-read 5 stars.;Book
I liked the book.  Held my interest all the way through, but I found the ending to be a bit disappointing, and somewhat contrived.;Book
A LITTLE CONFUSING AT TIMES.;Book
Engaging with enough twists to make you wonder. Slow start but amount of moving pieces pulls you in. Good summer read.;Book
A little boring and frustrating in parts;Book
Original, inventive, puzzling book that explores the thought processes around a suburban woman's bleak life.;Book
I know The Girl on the Train has gotten rave reviews, but when you get right down to it, it's a boring read.  I would not recommend it.;Book
Hard to stop reading!;Book
I thought it was good but it took me a while to get through because I kept getting confused.;Book
not as good as I thought. Kept waiting for something to happen. Ending was typical mystery ending.;Book
Omniscient voice would have been much easier to follow. And I jut couldn't make myself care about Rachel until the lat two chapters.;Book
This is an exciting read.  I like the way the chapters are divided up by the characters of the narrative, all of them women.  And, the women are not entirely likable.  I found myself unsympathetic at times, but drawn to their flaws, dramas, and insecurities.  It was a view of modern women but not the most modern of sensibilities--a pseudo-'60's millennial feel for one of the characters.  I don't want to give anything away, but one habit I had was to constantly check the dates of the narrative, whomever the author was focusing on--it goes back and forth, and drives the narrative forward and makes it suspenseful, but a bit hard to keep track of. What I liked about the read is that I commute daily to work on a train--reading standing up in a crowded train, sitting down, even missed my stop a couple of times.  Definitely worth reading...;Book
Poor alcoholic Rachel.  As she commutes daily on a train, heading towards a job she longer has, passing the same scenes daily, she creates a world of her own.  She fills it with characters that she assigns the perfect life, the perfect love.  Filling worthless, filled with longing for her ex husband and jealousy for his current wife and their new baby, she's witness to a murder.  Of course she's viewed with doubt.  After all she's an unreliable drunk who suffers blackouts and is obssessed with her ex husband's life. She sounds crazy and is viewed as such.  Twists and turns.  Some surprises.  I began to suspect who the murderer was half way through the book.  Still a good read that I kept going back to.  I felt real sorrow for Rachel.  Unable to move forward with her life, unable to admit that her past life is over, unable to decipher what memory is real and what is blurred by wine.  First time I have read htis aurthur.  I would read her again. Her characters are believable and I wanted to find out what happens to them;Book
Wonderful idea, poorly executed towards the end. I really wanted to like this, but the last half of the book DRAGGED. Maybe one good reveal every 45 minutes (used the audio book). It also started to feel a little messy and disorganized with the jumping perspectives and timelines. 3 stars because while a solid half of the book was annoying, I enjoyed the tail end.;Book
As I started this book,I was sure that I reading the story from someone who had suffered a major head trauma and was trying to remember something that was important at a place she no longer lived at.  I didn't realize that there was 3 different women telling different but connecting tales. One was an alcoholic, another a stay at home mom whose husband she stole from his wife (the alcoholic), and emotional distressed wife, having an affair with the husband of the other two. One of these women winds up dead .The solving of her murder falls to the other two because of their connection.  My impression of Rachel,the girl on the train, leaves me hoping there is a better future for those who try;Book
I tried so hard to like this story and stick it out, because I hate to give up on a book. Rachel, Anna, Jess/ Megan, Scott and whoever else ( ex hubby) were just so unlikeable. I couldn't identify with any of them because the protagonist was....well a train wreck from the beginning to end, and as far as I was concerned never got back on track. I understand being in love and having ones heart broken and everything else she was going through was awful, but it was really hard to identify with her on any level, because I didn't like her, and I tried. I didn't like her roommate either, who pops up a lot in the story. Towards the end when the truth came out it could've been exhilarating because I wasn't really expecting that, but personally I was just glad this train had pulled into the station and I could step off! Felt like all these characters should of been tied to the railway tracks,  Not much to say, it was a page turner, but only because I wanted to get to the end as fast as I could !;Book
I think the most surprising portion of the book encompasses Rachel's past. The complex, and tragic way the characters connect was interesting and made me want to read more.I will say that I called the ending. There was a portion of Megan's narration that just made it click. Of course, the book then distracts you into other appealing ideas, but they never quite pan out.The characters can be a bit of an annoyance. Rachel can be frustrating since she readily makes things more difficult for herself, and Anna is just a terrible person. When she talks, the malice is tangible.Overall, I did like it. I mean, I read it in two days, and I'm still looking forward to the film.;Book
"Rachel Watson is the miserable poster woman for a Borderline Personality-disordered alcoholic who is depressed, anxious and has no redeemable qualities as a human being.  The premise itself is interesting; the point of view of the voyeuristic train passenger who imagines the lives of those living along the tracks of her daily commute.  Rachel finds herself in the middle of a mystery she feels compelled to participate in as a main character.  Just when you think her obnoxious and unreliable participation will actually contribute to something positive and meaningful - you are reminded that she is so shallow and self-serving that nothing good will come from her interference.  The other characters are equally as shallow and self-serving.  Although the book is very well-written and certainly interesting in it's telling, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that everyone was unlikable.  Ultimately, I was disappointed in the fact that Rachel never became a better person and we never learned the source of her sociopathic behavior. There was no one to root for  (not even the police) and in the end I am baffled as to why everyone was as deranged as they were.";Book
Great novel to read by the pool, which is just what I did today. I caught the twist earlier than I was supposed to, but it didn't ruin the outcome for me. Being American, I liked the small differences in the language. Otherwise, the  story could have taken in Anyplace, Anywhere. The trains add an nice change of scenery. I'm rambling, but it's so hard to write a review like this without spoilers. Bottom line, I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to others!;Book
"The first half of The Girl on the Train was great. The characters were believable and their intersecting narratives helped to drive the novel forward. However, about half-way through the book, just about everything falls apart. The characters start engaging in activities that are contrived and clearly not believable.  (Is it even remotely believable that the main character would have sex with one of the other main characters?  (Note: I'm being intentionally cryptic to avoid spoilers)).  At that point, the narrative becomes strained and intentionally drawn out.  Finally, it is a well-known device of poorly written mysteries for the killer to ""tell all"" near the end of the novel.  The best mysteries lay out all of the pieces of evidence as they proceed and there's no need for the killer to engage in revelations at the end of the book because everything has already been laid out.  I raced through the last third of this book simply because I wanted to be finished and move on to something more rewarding.";Book
This is one of the best mysteries or novels I have read in a long time.  The story is about a woman, Rachel, who has been destoyed by the betrayal by her husband.  He left her for another woman and he and the new wife now have a baby.  This was a goal which Rachel dreamed of even spending thousands on experimental fertility procedures.  Her husband claims they couldn't spend anymore for that, but that it was all right to take expensive vacations..  After the divorce, Rachel drinks too much and loses her job.  However, she continues to ride the train into London making believe she is still employed.  Each day she passes her old neighborhood, an upscale subdivision where her ex-husband now lives in her house with his new wife and baby.  Down the street is another couple, a beautiful perfect couple, and Rachel begins to dream that this could have been her and her husband if only her dreams turned out.The author spins a story of intrigue and lies among married couples and the terrible tricks that are played.  She drops clues along the way, and the reader needs to be watchful and gather them up.  I recommend this very highly.  I believe this is a first novel, and I can't wait to read Ms. Hawkins next book.;Book
SPOILERS AHEAD.Better than expected! I didn't think the characters would be as well and fully developed as they were. My only issue was with the reveal of whodunnit at the end. I won't give it away entirely, but the person who actually committed the murder behaves completely opposite of how an actual person with their mental issues would behave. The author paints the person like a children's-story villain, not an actual human with the issues that would compel them to behave in the manner that they behave.Otherwise, everyone else acted and thought and behaved in a manner consistent with actual human psychology, and I was very impressed.;Book
While the novel is entertaining and one of those books you can read in a day, and though it keeps the reader in suspense some of the time, the prose is quite prosaic and the ending overly melodramatic (and in some sense a bit absurd-- as if written for a Hollywood blockbuster). Most of the characters are wholly unbelievable and superficial, and in some sense the gender stereotypes the book promotes has set us all back at least a few decades. Overall, the book was a quick read and it was, admittedly, gripping up until the last couple of chapters-- just as a bestseller produced for mass consumption should be. Beyond that, it cannot be defined as art or true literature, as intellectually pretentious that may sound.;Book
I'd looked at this title and read the blurb many times before I relented and bought the book.  I think I've been reading too much to know the difference between good writing and bad.  While the pride flowed well in this book it was often times confusing.  Jumping between dates, Megan, Rachel, and Anna, I often find myself flipping back pages to see if what I was reading happened before or after doomsday.  Then when I got about 75% done, the bad guy became blatantly obvious.  No real physiological twist there.  I guess this is a good book.  It spent too many weeks on the NYT bestseller list to not be, right?  And it's already been optioned for a movie.  Have readers in general just gotten easier to please?;Book
This thriller sucked me in. I loved how slowly the author unraveled the layers for the reader but still left enough questions to keep the reader doubting and questioning their own conclusions. I also applaud her strong multifaceted characterizations of all the female characters. They are all flawed but also real and they lack any shallow pretense. There is a melancholy intensity to all of them without being trite amd I appreciated them and the writing and story more for it.Writing from different character perspectives is difficult to achieve successfully but Hawkins does a great job of it.Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the combination of sharp, smart writing and thrillers.;Book
"This book really had me captured and sucked into the story. I would have read it straight through if I could have. The writer had me constantly trying to figure out who the ""bad guy"" was. I think that the writing was superb and the book kept me guessing.I highly recommend reading this book. It was full of suspense, drama, and a lot of twists and turns. Worth the money that I spent. The only downside is that the author gives your first person narrative of 3 women in the book and from time to time I had to keep flipping back to the beginning of the chapter because I'd forget the time line and who was narrating. The book has a lot of flash backs so it can get confusing at times. But over all I highly recommend this book!";Book
I read this book mostly because I like to read books that are about to become a movie and feel like I've beaten the suspense of waiting for it to come out! anyways, I don't know what all the big fuss is about! I mean it's a good story and all, I didn't see that ending coming but I started to figure it out about 3/4 of the book. I got the audiobook version so the listen is always good! I get a good sense of the characters by who is doing the dialogue. I just felt like the story was being dragged on! I feel like it could've been shorter and we still could've gotten the same ending! I mean I get it! She's a terrible alcoholic but it just kept being dragged on and on! But again this is not my typical read, so for what it was worth it was ok. I think you'll be ok if you just want to wait for the movie though!;Book
This was a nice, well rounded story with plenty to keep me reading. There wasn't too much going on and it was a pleasure to follow. Having said that, I didn't get what all of the hype is about with this book. It wasn't that powerful. The story itself was a great concept and told in 1st, 2nd and 3rd person. Rachel is a strong character and so is Megan and Anna.Rachel though, seems depressed and I think she's a little jealous of her ex's new situation. His new wife, a brand new baby. They moved into Rachel and Tom's old house and then he posts pictures on FB about how happy they are. Sad, but he isn't wrong for doing it. Everyone does it and though he and her didn't work out it isn't his fault that she is jealous or depressed.I had no idea beforehand how the end would come about and certainly don't want to spoil it here but it wasn't as strong in the suspense aspect as other rival novels in its genre and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I think this book tries really hard but it just can't get it done. It's not Gone Girl and it never will be. But It was still worth the read if you like books in this genre, though I expected more of a racy, suspenseful experience.;Book
A very disappointing read I found myself telling the characters to get a life.  It took me a couple chapters before I realized that there were three different girls as their voices were so similar. They make the most stupid spur of the moment decisions that get them into really bad situations especially Rachel and Megan. Anna is a piece of work I didn't like her at all.  I really didn't like any of the characters in this book and I found it very depressing and had to make myself finish it.  A few other people I spoke to about the book said that they couldn't finish it and that if I did I should tell them what happened. I am curious to see how they have made this into a movie.;Book
Honestly, I just don't like you. Yeah, you.... Rachel, Anne and Megan!I don't like your guys, husbands, and boyfriends in this book, either! In fact, I don't like ANYONE in this book!Does the writer make attempts at creating sympathy for some of these characters? Yeah...sort of. But there is a general disgust for everyone that is hard to shake off. I must admit, in the first couple chapters there is a fascinating draw to the narrative that did keep me reading...and reading...making me nauseous sometimes, sick and disgusted by stupid choices of our narrator, and then I became bored in the middle.I wanted to finish it, but I was sick of reading it. I put it down (metaphorically, since it's a Kindle) read something else and came back to finish it.And the finish was good. SCARY GOOD and mostly satisfying. No spoilers, sweetie! Just if you are looking for a book where you root for character and want to CARE for a main character, well....this ain't your book, baby. Much like Gone Girl where the unreliable narrative and unlikeable characters drive the story, this one has me shaking my head and drinking Pellegrino water!;Book
Reading The Girl on the Train is like peeling an onion. The deeper you get into the story, the closer you get to understanding the central characters.  The main character, Rachel, is struggling on many levels. Half the time I was frustrated with her and the other half I wondered how and when she would regain her memory of that night when Megan disappeared and the part she might have played.  One of the most important elements of the plot is time. I would recommend that readers remember the key date, July 13, to keep from getting lost because Hawkins skillfully moves the plot in concentric circles around that date.  This is a page-turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it.;Book
This is an excellent psychological thriller about an alcoholic and her imaginations from riding a train daily.  She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.  As a recovering alcoholic, I found it a little difficult to live through her drunken sprees and blackouts but it all comes together in the end with the unexpected ending. Highly recommend it.;Book
I've had this book and in my library for a few months now. It was recommended but I just wasn't feeling it. A friend was starting to read it, so I thought I'd join her and we could talk about it. Well I started on a Monday and finished on Wednesday! It's one of those books that you have to pay attention to the details, the dates, the names, etc...  It was an easy read, kept me on my toes and suspense filled. Excited to see what they do with the movie.;Book
"Turning ""Girl on a Train"" into a movie is a new high/low in redundancy because it reads like a movie script, anyway; a novel for readers who like a lot of TV.  The characters are believable because they're ordinary, and they're easily forgotten because they don't say or do anything remarkable, clever, or challenging.  The device of the train is not exactly new, but a good writer with a feel for mystery and compelling characters could run with its possibilities.  The protagonist, Rachel, is an alcoholic filled with self-pity.  She is currenly exhausting the patience of her last codependent friend.  Oh, it's no use trying to review a book this shallow.  If only it had some wit or even a point.";Book
This book really wowed me.  I found it simply by seeing it listed on Amazon.  I didn't read a review, just took a gamble.  I don't read a lot of thrillers, but want to read more after this one.  Don't compare this to Gone Girl - it's way better, and way difference.  I really wanted to binge read this one, I wish I could have.  The characters were richly drawn, although sad in some cases, and the story was engrossing.  The story revolves around a woman not remembering critical (and potentially dangerous) events because she was black-out drunk, which was really unique and interesting - you got the sense of frustration on the main character's part to try and put the pieces of the puzzle together.  Loved it.....highly recommended.;Book
"First and foremost, the writing in this book is bad. By the end of the first page, I knew it wouldn't even come close to living up to the hype and Gone Girl comparisons. The writing does not grab you or keep your attention, so finishing the book felt more like a chose than something I was interested in doing.The characters and the plot are poorly developed. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. Several of the plotlines end up being completely pointless (ie they had nothing to do with the final ""twist"" or the fate of the main character).. I guess they are supposed to increase suspense but in my opinion reading the book was similar to the experience of watching someone bake a delicious cake and then throwing it away. I kept reading even though I was bored because I anticipated a shocking twist and interesting resolution (probably in large part because of all the Gone Girl comparisons), but the story never picks up steam or becomes interesting.Ultimately, I would advise against reading this.. if you're like me, you'll probably read it anyway because of all the hype, but it's really not worth your time.";Book
A disturbing feeling. That's how I describe reading the life of the girl on the train. Her interest in complete strangers, a young couple who live on the same street as her ex husband and his new wife, is voyeuristic and downright creepy. She goes so far as to name them and imagine their relationship. This beginning sets up a dysfunctional mix of two neighboring couples and the ever watchful girl on the train--the ex-wife who is alcoholic and rides the train every morning to pretend she is still working a job so her roommate won't kick her out. In between her binges she puzzles over missing segments of her life that she fidgets with until convinced she has the missing part to the murder of the neighbor wife. If you like a snoop into  the lives of unstable, violent, and bizarre behavior this is your novel. The talent of the author that intrigued me was withholding information and weaving snippets of supposed truth throughout. At least it made me read to the end. This is a read with no literary merit. And personally, I would rather not have had these people enter my life. I found it disturbing and unsettling.;Book
"It isn't hard to put yourself in the position of the narrator. Every day you ride the same train on the same route with the same people into the same huge city where you're another anonymous cog in the wheel. Your sense of being invisible has become literal; you no longer care what passengers think of you as you open the gins and tonic (they're sold in cans in England) that will make the day go by in a pleasant fog. As far as you're concerned, you're a nobody. And each time the train passes your ex-husband's house, which used to be yours, you know that you're nobody. You see the new wife, the one he was seeing before he left you. And you notice that the daughter they had is getting bigger.So, you've trained yourself to look a few houses down. There's a woman sitting in her front garden. Some mornings she's reading; other times she's drinking a cup of tea. The man who comes out and joins her is not bad looking, and so, with nothing else to do you start to make up stories about the lives of the couple. After all, if you were still married, you'd be neighbors. And you decide that you'd be friends. Until. One morning. When everything changes.";Book
Very slow getting started.  With alternating narrators and dates that are important but sometimes jump back and forth, I wished I were reading a book instead of my Kindle.  I ended up taking notes to avoid significant confusion.  I took notes up to about 41%.  By then everything was pretty easy to follow, but the dates continued to be critically important.  Once I got to 49% I was deeply involved and it was intense and enjoyable and I finished in about 24 hours, during which I did other things as well.  It was somewhat like Gone Girl although I ended up liking this and I totally hated Gone Girl because I didn't care if either character lived or died, in fact I wish she had died at the end.  These characters, while flawed people were at least sympathetic.;Book
I have mixed feelings about this novel. Like Gone Girl, it is a dark, surprising tale, and like Gone Girl, this novel features unreliable narration. Beyond that, I'm not so sure why there are so many comparisons between the two novels. I enjoyed the multiple points of view, and I appreciated that the characters were drawn with such unapologetic realism and complexity. That being said, there wasn't one likeable character in the entire novel, and while reading it, I desperately wished for just one positive nuance in any one of the characters. I also found that because this book was told out of chronological order, the various dates became difficult to keep up with. I was utterly delighted by the ending. I never once guessed what was actually going to happen, and in a novel of this level of dark suspense, that is a tremendous achievement. If you enjoy unreliable narration or a good, dark psychological thriller like Gone Girl or Mudvein, then I definitely think this book is worth the read. I will be very interested to see what Ms. Hawkins writes next.;Book
...and I cannot say anymore without completely spoiling it. In the beginning, it looked like a mystery built exclusively around the weakness of two of the main characters (one alcoholic with blackouts, one manic pixie dream girl wannabe unreliable narrator), but the slow burn ending and the perspective of the very sensible, cold and practical third protagonist brings on the reread element, just for kicks and foreshadowing.Only four stars because all of the characters (except Cathy, who is a cinnamon roll too good for this world) rely heavily on the reproduction / maternity angle for background issues and motivation, and I personally find it a bit of a cliché. It is still a great read!;Book
"While I typically don't take the time to write reviews of novels, since I feel a good review should include more thoughtful analysis than, ""this was a good book"" or ""I recommend it"", I feel the need to review this book. While I was inspired to purchase this book due to the abundance of positive reviews, I was quite disappointed. The story was flat, uninspiring. I heard that it will be turned into a motion picture, which makes me question, how many of the scenes will be of a disheveled alcoholic sitting on a train (doesn't sound too exciting of a movie)?The book was a quick read, I finished it over the course of weekend. You won't walk away with a profound understanding of alcoholics or anything of that nature. I say skip the book and just wait for the movie to come out, that way you'll waste less of your time.";Book
I found the lead character was an alcoholic stalker who needed serious help. She should have been reported for stalking a long time ago. That said life is full of people like her and the other weird abusers unfortunately.The book was nothing like I expected and I  did appreciate the style it was written in. Some of it was predictable with character personalities to who did it. I guess my rating is due to expecting more from all of the hype it got.;Book
One of the best books I've read in a really long time. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie, and I'm glad I did. They were both fantastic, but I think reading the book first gave me a better interpretation of the movie. Though the plot was twisted and dark, the characters were incredibly engrossing. As more and more information came to light, the plot just became more and more enticing. It is a little easy to see the ending coming from about halfway through, but there are enough other things going on that it doesn't take away from the read. It's just unbelievable to me that this is a debut novel because it's such an amazing read.;Book
Really, really good...better than I expected really, and with a lot of psychological complexity that doesn't fully come clear until the payoff at the end. Honestly found parts of it difficult to read. I normally really struggle with books about addiction or with addicts as main characters...much less narrators...so it's really a tribute to the writing that I found it impossible to put down, in spite of that.While I suspected/guessed aspects of that ending, that psychological complexity I mentioned still made the payoff really worthwhile. I found myself thinking about layers of that days later, in terms of the dimensionality of the characters themselves. I don't want to say too much due to the spoiler thing, but anyone who knows anything about trauma and how it affects people will probably pick up on a lot of this, especially in relation to the Rachel character and her spiral following her divorce.A great mystery story...and a great psychological thriller. I'll definitely be looking out for more by this author!;Book
"I wanted to love this book, but I was disappointed. The characters are shallow and boring. The ""girl""  and other  female characters are weak and present as victims. They have been mistreated, but fall into the don't help yourself mode of dealing with their circumstances. That's not me. The structure of the book felt contrived- as in I don't have an interesting tale so I'll add a confusing format. The telling was tedious and only got interesting near the end and then there was some additional prose that seemed to have no purpose as an ending. I'm sure it will be an entertaining movie w the right actors, but the book was a flop for me.";Book
I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but the only thing holding me back was that I thought that the ending wasn't as detailed as the rest of the book and felt a little rushed. However, it didn't detract from the story and the story was fabulous in every way!  It took me about 3 or 4 chapters to get my head around who the main character was. It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story. I would recommend reading if you like a psychological drama/thriller.;Book
I have not been able to get completely absorbed by a crime novel in a long time. If you add the fact that I tend to be a contrarian reader, i.e. I tend NOT to read what everyone raves about, I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this little masterpiece.Story is all told in the first person by the three main female characters, which keeps the pace fast enough to keep you turning pages but also gives you pause to think and absorb. You will probably figure out the culprit as you start delving into the thick of the book, but it doesn't really matter: Anna, Rachel and Megan will make you grimace, smile, cringe and always find a way to reach inside of you. That's the most stunning feature of this book: I read many novels that made me connect with THE main character, but I have seldom found myself in the shoes of all the key characters.My final piece of advice: pick it up before you go on vacation, or off for long relaxing weekend, maybe if you have long train commutes (ahem) ahead of you. I promise you'll be so captured you'll struggle to put you Kindle down.;Book
Now I see why The Girl On The Train is this year's Gone Girl.  Rachel rides the train daily to London, watching one particular couple as she passes their house.  She playfully names them Jess and Jason and creates their own perfect fantasy marriage.  But one day, the lady of the house is nowhere to be seen.  Rachel suspects foul play.  She confronts the police and nearby neighbors.  There's one huge catch: Rachel has a drinking problem.  She's an unreliable witness, and has an ugly past with the neighborhood.  If she keeps prying, Rachel could become the next headline.  Written from the perspective of Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins displays her Train ladies as journal entries, taken in morning and evening segments.  Will anyone ever believe Rachel, especially the fateful night she can't quite remember?  Is Anna really the sweet, caring, overprotective mom?  And what about Megan, the missing artist with the twisted past?  Hitchcock in its styling, with enough red herrings to open an aquarium, and a tarnished heroine the reader can root for, The Girl On The Train is well worth the ticket. I can't wait for the movie!;Book
"On the cover of this book SJ Watson calls it 'Gripping, enthralling - a top-notch thriller and a compulsive read'. I agree 100%I simply could not put this book down.It is well written - tight, tense and thrilling all the way. Reading it is like riding a roller coaster.Who is telling the truth?Who is lying?Rachel, an emotionally unstable alcoholic who has recently lost her marriage and her job, rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretence she still has a job.Everyday she passes the back of the street where she used to live - when she was married - and every day she looks.She makes up stories about the people in the houses - one couple in particular.Then one day she sees something; something that changes the way she sees these people and that will involve her in their lives.A compulsively readable, emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller; this is an electrifying debut embraced by readers across markets and categories.I have read some really good books this year, but this is far and away the best.";Book
The premise of the story about watching people and their lives while on a train appealed to me. I can imagine making up stories about the people you would see every day.  However, I found I was not looking forward to reading it. The author kept going back and forth with dates and flashbacks and I found myself backtracking to see what date we were on. The story developed too slowly and the characters were just not all that interesting. I put the book down after reading more than half of it. I was just not enjoying it. I will not read another book by this author.;Book
It was a good read because I never read another story like this but, the characters were awful. Not one person, except the room-mate, had any good character traits so I found the story went nowhere. I found myself not caring about what happened to any one of these deplorable people. I also found the ending anticlimactic because it didn't matter who did what- the story could have gone in almost any direction without any surprise ending.;Book
"The story is ok in a twisty / turning kind of way.  Since the reader jumps between 3 characters POV, we sometimes see the same event multiple times, from different perspectives.  I didn't have a problem with the story, which is a very convoluted "" who dunnit,"" with an incredibly dull and predictable ending.  Rather I found the characters flat and underdeveloped.  There are three voices, and they all sound exactly the same.  But for Ms. Hawkins telling you what character is narrating, you'd never know which woman is which.  The three narrators are given slightly unique traits: one's a drinker, the other has a baby and the last one is missing.  The audio book was superior because three women narrated so they had actual unique voices, which helped differentiate the otherwise similar characters.I wouldn't recommend the book, but if you need something to while away a short plane ride, it isn't terrible.";Book
"Here's the deal. There is no doubt that the author is an amazing at describing places, people. and things, as well as developing inner thoughts. However, like the title, it began slowly as if the train is starting to move, and then the rhythm begins which is a good thing. What weighed me down was that there was not one strong character that took the lead. I could not connect to whiney women, and men I knew little about. The good news is that if you're a woman, you'll identify with the ""I'm every woman"" concept that carries through the novel. Nothing is new under the sun here, except finding ""whodunnit."" The novel could another editing go around as there are missing words that slow the read.  If you're a Hawkins fan, you know that there will be a whole bunch of reality mixed in with some mystery.";Book
Although the style of writing from each character's point of view is something we have all seen before, this novel really allows this method to develop the characters.  The reader gets to see, from all angles, what is happening.  The plot keeps you guessing:  I must have changed my mind seven times in trying to figure out who was responsible.  You definitely can elate to our main character's perspective when on the train, in particular if you ever were or are currently a commuter.  You get involved with her thoughts and you realize that you may have done the same type of fantasizing in your travels.  A few twist, but not so many that you get lost.  A good, fast read.;Book
Very well written and easy to follow in spite of the fact that it was told in first person by each of three different women from each of their perspectives.  The chapter would be titled with the first name of whichever woman was talking and it would go back and forth. Even though this sounds confusing, it was not.  None of the characters were particularly lovable, just flawed in their own ways.  It was very suspenseful and moved the reader along well.  Except for being the tiniest bit drawn out, it was very hard to put down.  I didn't figure out the ending before the point at which they wanted me to know the ending, and that's always good.  Would recommend it to fans of suspenseful novels and murder mysteries.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this as well.;Book
"The main characters are all women.  The problem is that they are all so sick.  I could not ""root"" for any one of them.  I always need a character that I like and am on there side.  But no, not is this case The writing as a skill did not particularly create any differences between in any of the three women.  They were all one dimensional.  I know who the killer is and the killer is of course-sick.  Oh well,  it will help me like the next book on the night stand";Book
"I read reviews about how good a book this was; otherwise, I would never have bought it.  The reviews, however, are hyped, overstated in terms of the ""suspense"" and ""leaving you guessing at every moment.""  That is why I gave this book 4 stars, along with the complexity of the novel.  I read the entire thing in two sittings over 8 hours last Friday, but I had to keep reading to keep all the stuff straight--who was doing what, etc.  I almost had to draw a picture to keep track of what was going on.  The book is told from the perspectives of three women:  Rachel, Megan, and Anna.  So you always had to keep in mind what perspective you were reading.  Then whoever was telling the story, was dated and timed, like August  5, 2013, early morning, mid morning, evening, etc.  And then the next section might be July 5, 2013, so you had to think, ""Oh, yeah, this is one month before the last section, but now it is from a different woman's perspective.""  See how confusing this gets?";Book
The novel is perfectly paced, even though I know some who said it was really slow in the beginning. I, personally, prefer when the author takes us into the minds of his/her characters, showing us who they are, what they want, what they dream about. I like a slow burn. I don’t need to jump into the action on page three. But it is just me.The main female characters are drawn beautifully. One is an obsessed wreck of a woman. Another is a manic, complicated and a very unhappy girl. Finally, the third woman is a mistress who becomes the second wife, and who gleefully gloats about it. What’s not to love about this assemble of women?The story is twisted. The plot is tight. The main narrator is unreliable because most of the time she is drunk and cannot remember anything. Important details are presented to us methodically. Our fist impressions of each character are slowly warped by each unexpected and twisty revelation. You will question everything and everyone.In the end, however, you will be greatly satisfied. The ending is immaculate.;Book
It's hard to give a book 3 stars when it really kept me tied to my Kindle. But there's a strange dichotomy here. It's a rather dark thriller which kept me guessing until about page 170, where I sort of guessed how things meshed together. But I did not like the characters. Apart from aspects of Scott, I could not feel the empathy a reader should have with at least one or two characters. Rachel, the alcoholic, is one of those women who seem to moan and whine and irritate people. She irritated me, and her frequent and total blackouts after binge drinking were not always convincing. Anna is such a typical weak and clingy type -- but at the very end she's suddenly this amazingly strong woman just when the reader expects her to fall apart. Megan's psychiatrist remains a very vague figure, as does Megan herself. In fact, Megan is the least convincing character.But hey, there's a murder ...nuff said, I don't want to spoil the book for you. The atmosphere right through is somewhat depressing and humour is completely absent. But I guarantee you -- the book will still keep you reading until the very last page.;Book
The writer has infused life into the most wretched of characters. The ugliness, the mediocrity of everyday lives becomes interesting. There is no glamour, no great beauty, no riches, no great philosophy revealed, or perfect and passionate love obtained. The author reveals that humanity in its rawest form, at its humblest moments has a story worth telling. In our every day lives the stories are not revealed, even when we play a part in them, we don't always  understand the story or our roles within it.  The author helps us to step back and view the lives of these characters, understanding their stories and leaving us with the desire to examine our own stories and the characters in them a little more closely. This book is a good read. Like a train trip, it is a pleasant and strangely comforting ride. The epiphany is not actually arriving at the destination but is broken up into tiny bits, distributed in observations and insights discovered during the ride.;Book
I haven't re it yet but my wife loved it and couldn't put it down.;Book
Not my style.;Book
I really enjoyed it;Book
awfully coincidental, but page turner;Book
Really enjoyed the book.;Book
Very good book!;Book
Just ok.;Book
Love, love this book.;Book
I love it.;Book
Would not get my nose out of;Book
Good plight;Book
Pretty much fantastic.;Book
Could not get into it.;Book
The plot, such as it was, was rife with holes and inconsistencies. There wasn't a single likable or reliable to be found. The women were all victims-of themselves, of men, of each other. The men were all abusive and two out if three were openly misogynist. I was astonished to find the author was a woman - as the woman-hating tone started early and ran so deep. I suppose you could write it off to artistic license if the book were otherwise engaging, entertaining or thought-provoking - but it's not.;Book
A good read.  I enjoyed it.;Book
too redundant;Book
I absolutely hated this book.  It was a nightmare of self-analysis, insecurity, drunken blackouts, and soap opera drama.Ugh!  Save your money.;Book
My first time ever reading anything by this author I found the book to be very entertaining.I was a little confused in the beginning with the characters,but I kept reading and just enjoyed the book all the way to the end. The ending was a shocker didn't see that one coming. This book is a definitely must read put on your list...;Book
Great story..loved the characters.;Book
A must read!;Book
a thriller indeed!;Book
Very suspenseful - with a twist!;Book
Page turner!!;Book
This book is so good, the most interesting, most shocking, best book I've read in years! The story will grab you and won't let go!! Read it!!!!;Book
Great read!;Book
Creepy, but really good!;Book
A tad hard to follow but great read!;Book
Very exciting;Book
Fast read, particularly at the beginning .;Book
It was thrilling!;Book
This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat.;Book
The best thing about the book was that it did become very interesting in the last three chapters.  The most difficult part of the book was keeping the timeline and the characters straight. As a result, I had a difficult time finishing the book. Nevertheless, I try to finish a book club book so I can reasonably participate in the discussion. All of the characters are desperately flawed. It seems so unlikely to have so many dysfunctional people in one plot. If one is willing to suspend that disbelief, the outcome is, perhaps, less surprising. Therefore, I found it to be tedious even to the end. I am still surprised that the detectives, who had been so suspicious of everyone, were so willing to let the culprits go with only one standing up for the other. There was no reason for them to let them go without further investigation. Perhaps the story would take on a completely different aspect if told from the point of view from the detectives. As an English teacher, I would love to hear my students reconstruct the plot from the various points of view!  Fascinating idea!;Book
"An extremely well written book that I have found myself recommending to countless others. It is a real page turner that kept me guessing to the end. I thought it a really unusual and novel presentation of a psychological thriller; knowing the Victorian houses that line the railway tracks into London, I often found myself wondering about the people who lived behind their doors and windows . Writing the three main characters in the first person was an excellent idea allowing a more intimate knowledge of these women and none more so than the girl on the train herself. An unbelievably good, more than good, first novel, Paula Hawkins has a lot to live up to!";Book
"I put off buying this book because my husband always whines if I buy books written by women since he reads everything I buy and usually hates the 'female' point of view--.but this time--I read the book in an afternoon and evening and he decided to give it a try.  I thought maybe he'd hate it--it's first person ""female""...but he loved it--I totally lost him for the evening as he was engrossed from page one.The story is a sad one in many ways--especially if you or anyone close to you has an issue with addiction.  Simply reading the book can put you off alcohol for awhile.  The characters ring true--you ache for the main character and feel her confusion and fear.  I usually can figure out the 'who done it' by the time I'm a third of the way through most any mystery, but this one kept me guessing and even when I guessed right I didn't want to believe it.Fast paced--the kind of book you fall into and don't want to put down.  And--for all the men who fear women writers for their sentimentality--this is the perfect read.";Book
Like so many others have written in these reviews, I kept waiting for something momentous to happen.  Nothing.  It's just the stupidest story I can imagine. No wonder Hollywood has optioned it!  If you like reading about depressing alcoholics, stalkers, and ridiculous side characters, then this book is for you. No thank you. Yuck.;Book
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion.";Book
"This is an engaging story of human frailties and trials. It is told in the first person, by different characters, which gives an extra layer of interest. There are no really ""good"" characters, but there is one very definitely ""bad"" one, and that identity remains a secret until almost the end. I read this book as part of a book club, and, as one of my fellow members put it, ""I didn't like any of the characters, but I loved thebook."" Couldn't agree more!";Book
"I like to read the really negative reviews, to see why someone hated a book I truly enjoyed.  The most consistent complaint is that none of the three main women characters were likeable, in fact, pretty much unlikeable.  I agree.  But so what.  You always have to have some likeable character?  Life is not like that.  If you need always someone likeable, stick to books written for teens.  Some had trouble following the plot.  It is not tricky at all, in fact, Ms. Hawkins is pretty ingenious in the way she plots this book.  A lot of books move backwards and forwards in time for seemingly no reason other than to be literary; this book has excellent reasons and it works.  Finally some claimed they figured out the (SPOILER ALERT) killer before coming close to being finished.  Baloney.  This is well-written, well-plotted, different and well done.  Sure if you think back on it some of it seems preposterous, but, there are very few mysteries in which that does not happen.  Congratulations Mr. Hawkins.  Well done.  Don't let the critical ducks nibble you to death.";Book
"The storyline does a reasonable job of exploring the personalities of the characters, particularly the images in the imagination of ""The Girl On The Train"" in and of herself as she sees images from something of a distance, and frames illusions about what they mean. From my perspective this presents a tale of a person who really doesn't seem to know herself very well, replaces ""knowledge"" with suppositions, as well as other characters in the play, and as events unfold they grope through and eventually learn more about their foundations of themselves and among each other.Yes, there is some mystery that unfolds in a very slow way, and my guess is that we as readers actually know some people that have issues as told in the story that the characters will remind us of knowing. It is possible that some readers will ""see"" themselves in the tale. For those, that I'd guess would be in the minority, the work might trigger some inspiration although in and of itself I would not call this work inspirational nor would it qualify as dynamic: revealing; yes.";Book
I didn't enjoy the start of this book and nearly put it down but because I didn't have anything else to read at the time I persevered and am glad I did. Whilst the whodunit side was fairly obvious by the third quarter of the book I was compelled to finish as I had finally found some empathy for the main character. I'm not sure I would bother reading one of her novels again but am not disappointed that I read this. The main issue for me was the dislikable main character who wasn't quite complex enough to be interesting either;Book
Very thought provocative.;Book
Great summer read!;Book
I would recommend this book to people who like mysteriesMy husband is also reading the book  I love the detail that the novel goes into I enjoy reading  because books transform me to other places and help to inspire my imagination;Book
Great;Book
Boring;Book
I enjoyed it very much,;Book
Somewhat plodding though. Character development good. Enjoyed the British location. Should make a good basis for a movie. Going to remember the cork screw as weapon.;Book
So I needed to stop reading...when I clearly was so engrossed in these pages.  Loved the book, I don't read to try and figure out what's going to happen, in this case total shocker, I read to enjoy each page. Now I can watch the movie with clear expectations.  I recommend for a quick read;Book
I can't believe people actually like this!  This is boring, predictable, and just plain stupid.  There are basically a handful of events that just repeat itself until the writer decides it's enough.  The characters are boring and not likable.  The plot is repetitive.  They are all one dimensional.  I had 5th grade students who write like this.  There is no suspense.;Book
"Better than the movie and takes place in London.  make sure you pay attention to which character is ""speaking"" in each chapter or you'll get confused.";Book
"Took me a while to adapt to the writer's style, but the story kept me going and I soon got accustomed to the very ""British"" style (and the somewhat anaccronistic setting as the story developed). No wonder it was adapted into a blockbuster motion picture!!";Book
"Not my usual genre (I am a historical fiction, nonfiction, period piece kind of gal) and I normally shy away from best sellers. Read only because a coworker said it was better than ""Gone Girl"" (which I did not care for at all) and my mom kept asking if I knew what all the hubbub was about this book. A few pages into it I was totally hooked and couldn't put it down (laundry didn't get done and the b.f barely got supper). I HAD to find out whodunit. A little predictable (I figured it out about halfway through) but still an engaging read through to the end. Definitely had a Hitchcock vibe and would make a great movie! My mom, also an avid reader, was a little more lukewarm about it. She thought it was okay, but definitely not her style (she is a romance/historical fiction/Nora Roberts fan). We both were entertained and decided in the end it was money well spent (but then when is money spent on a book not well spent).";Book
Okay, let me first admit that I am not a fan of 'psychological' novels, and had I known this was one, I wouldn't have bought it.  Nor am I happy with authors who use something like psychology and/or addiction to get the character to do something totally brain-dead.  This author used both.  This is one of those stories that would be an essay if the heroine just used some common sense (just a teeny bit of common sense!) in the first chapter.  In addition, I didn't like a single character in the book and was severely tempted to stop reading it, but I knew I wanted to write a review, so I must read the whole thing.  The character closest to likable was Cathy, who was super-nice and a major enabler of Rachel's psychological and addiction problems--basically a doormat and doing all the wrong things.;Book
A caution I neglected to heed was all of the comments comparing this book to Gone Girl, another book I really did not like. Instead I looked at all of the reviews raving about the book and plunked my money down. Unless you enjoy muddled mysteries with unlikeable people and can totally suspend logic, steer clear!;Book
Great book! Fast read, brilliantly written. The suspense was awesome. Never knowing until the end who the actual killer was.  Rachel on the verge of the end but hanging in there trying her best to pull it together in order to help those characters who had become her only life after her divorce. And Cathy for not giving up on Rachel, not approving but never really letting her go. The ties that binds real friends and caring people. In a time when it's easier to look the other way. Once again overall it was an awesome book. Will definitely recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you Paula for writing this book.;Book
The plot is thin and all problems are solved when the main character's blackout memory gap suddenly resolves itself . . . despite the author's repeated warnings throughout the book that this is not how blackouts work. But it doesn't matter. By the end you don't care who dies or who survives because the characters are so ridiculously unlikable. Spoiler alert: Don't bother pushing through to the end under the assumption that it has to get better. It does not.;Book
This is from one who has read some and drunk some more and I would say the main focus in this book is on the alcohol addiction and how that befuddles you and less on the actual crime. Good  insight in the alcohol department and other potential addictions.  I would have loved to see how Rachel would manage to get sober with good support  and get her life back and then solve the crime in question.;Book
I read this book in ONE weekend...and I have a toddler.  It is the definition of a page turner.  It is told from 3 sets of views.  Rachel is the main character.  She is a young woman living a life of lies.  Her alcoholism cost her marriage, job and dream life.  To keep up appearances, she rides the train to the job she no longer holds.  She takes this opportunity to watch the house her ex husband and new wife live in.  She also becomes obsessed with the neighbors, Jess, a few houses down.  She make believes a life for them and creates a story surrounding the beautiful woman and her husband.  Her obsessive nature leads to several run ins with her ex husband and his new wife and former mistress, Anna.  After an alcohol filled night she discovers Jess is missing and she has no  recollection of the night.  All she knows is that she was on that street and had an altercation with Anna.  It is a gripping page turner and about the time you think you have it figured out... guess again!;Book
I wonder if I was the only person who hoped that Rachel would also at some point, be murdered. She was almost unbearably pathetic and unfortunately without any other strong, likable characters I just found myself whipping through the book so I didn't have to be reading it anymore.;Book
I downloaded a sample of this book on my Kindle.  When I finished the sample I chose not to purchase it at that time and maybe read it later. What I had read in the sample was slow, depressing and just not of much interest to me.  After having several people tell me they liked it, I purchased it.  I'm glad I read the  entire book, but it took over 1/2 way through for me to look forward to picking it up and reading it.  The girl is an alcoholic, which is depressing enough, but she rides this train everyday and noses into other peoples lives who live in houses along the train tracks by watching them as she rides by.  Although all of those things she witnessed during her train rides tie into the story later on in the book, it was depressing and boring to me at first.  At the point where I started to see how it all tied together, the book got quite interesting and I'm glad I stayed with it.  Had me guessing to the end about what really took place.  Glad my friends pushed me to read the book.  It was worth it.;Book
I found it difficult to get into the book.  After reading the first fifty pages, I had a hard time picking it back up to read.I was on an airplane with time to kill which is why I finished the book.The first half of the book rambled and was hard to relate to the characters.  The last third of the book was more interesting,but I'm not sure if it was worth the pain and boredom to get there.  The story line dragged on and on.  But, her characterdevelopment was pretty good.  Towards the end of the book, I began to gain more understanding/sympathy of Rebecca,Megan, Tom, and other characters.  The author's writing style was average to me in comparison to, what I think, are better writers,e.g., Patrick Smith, Nelson DeMille, Pat Conroy, et. al.Bottom line, maybe the book is a better read for those more sensitive and emotional than me.;Book
"The first few pages pulled me in; the way the characters or at least the central female characters each got a turn to ""talk"".  I connected with them even if I would not want to be their friend.  The personality of many of these characters frustrated me to no end as one is an alcoholic - and all are self-involved - but then I would imagine the portrayal of the alcoholic was true-to-life.  I know it is with the self-involved individuals.It was interesting to see how deeply you can be involved in someone’s life without actually knowing that person.  It speaks to our voyeur society and the interconnection of events through our life.The end was not predictable although someone might argue that it was wrapped up a bit too smoothly.  I still had questions at the end – so everything was not answered to my satisfaction.Regardless, it was never boring and the pace is fast.  I would like to have another book this minute that would entertain me as this one did.";Book
I came close to dumping this book after about 4 chapters...it is a slow-burn.  I really disliked where I thought it was going. But, since it was on the Best Seller List, I thought there just had to be more to it. I was so pleasantly surprised at how this book developed.  It was really, really good!  I hope this author can write more books that are this full of surprises!;Book
The girl on the train is Rachel.  When the train stops at the signals, Rachel follows the movements of the couple who live at 11 Blenheim Road.  In her imagination they are Jess and Jason. In fact they are Scott and Megan.  A few doors down that road live Tom, Rachel's ex-husband, and his new wife, Anna. Rachel imagines a blissfully in love couple and is shocked when she sees another man in the back yard with Megan in an intimate embrace. Then there is the news that Megan is missing.  Rachel feels compels to assist the police.  And so the complex investigation begins.  However, underlying the whole story is Rachel's alcoholism and her propensity to invent things (tell lies).  The narration is shared between Rachel, Megan and Anna.  Rachel tries to fight her alcoholism and this has a poignant insight into the struggle of an addict to try to kick the habit – with always an excuse to procrastinate – “I'll start tomorrow”.  It always bothers me when the author chooses to tell the murder in the victim's voice.  The underlying theme of the book, one could say, is “truth or lies”.;Book
As much as the book was interesting, I have to say I just really didn't like it.;Book
Interesting book that puts you in the mind of Gone Girl, but this book is not as well written. Even though I pretty much read it in one sitting, it bogged down about 40% in - I couldn't see where it was going which you would think is a good thing, but there was just too much drunk Rachel.  I got kinda tired of reading it, but I rarely start a book and not finish it.  Besides, it picked back up after a major discovery and that made it easier to finish.  I read this because my sister read it first and wanted me to as well before we see the movie.  It's likely this will be one of the few movies that are better than the book it's based on.  3.5 stars;Book
I will be honest the book was amazing. It pulled you in to the lives of everyone in the book. You felt there anger, pain, and confusion. You trusted and you were betrayed. You somehow become part of the book trying to figure out who killed Megan. It kept you captured with sleepless nights. Until the end. Sadly the ending left unsatisfied. It didn't quench my thirst on how the characters were left off. It just left you hanging, hoping for more but sadly nlothing else will come. I wished the author ended it without the cliffhanger, in my opinion. But all in all the book was great but ending sucked. So I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.;Book
I'm bedridden after surgery so just finished reading Girl on the Train to pass the time.What I liked: the plot. I found it an unusual writing style to tackle the story from a commuter's perspective.What I didn't like: not one single character. For me, I don't have to fall in love with a character (I certainly didn't with Gone Girl and I loved that book). But Rachel, the main character was thin, underdeveloped, shallow, weak, self-pitying and a drunk. The book is told by three characters, Rachel being the main one. Anna is married to Rachel's ex-husband, whom Rachel still pines for. Anna is vapid, self-centered and flat out annoying. Megan (who is first known as Jess in Rachel's fairy-tail version of people she views from the train window) is mentally unstable with a sordid past.I figured out the ending about two thirds through. This was disappointing because I like to be utterly shocked by a book's ending. It's not the worst book I've read, but certainly not the best. It'll do.;Book
Very clever concept. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours straight through, finishing up at 2 am. Rachel is a mess, but that adds to the suspense and I think a lot of women who've ever been cheated on could identify with her, and with most of the female characters at least on some level, no matter how dark and messed up they can be. Overall, I thought it was well worth my time and money and I'd read it again.;Book
A depressed girl lives in a fantasyland, refuses to move on, rides the train everyday, pretends to work, creates a life for some people she sees who lived by her old house. She gets so drunk all the time she has blackout moments. The girl she created a life for goes missing. She inserts herself into the investigation because she has nothing else to do. The whole book goes back and forth between what happened, I'm scared, she acts completely paranoid, and round and round we go. I just wanted the book to get on with it!!  Seriously how many times can we stand to listen to her internal monologue?  Not to mention this book is extremely depressing. Author needs an editor. I got tired of the same drivel that didn't seem to move the story along. And don't even get me started on how pathetic every single woman was portrayed in this book. I think the idea was good but way to slow paced for me.;Book
"What I loved about the book was the concept. How many times have you driven past the same houses, same people, and imagined what their lives would be like? The story begins as a daily commuter, Rachael, who struggles with alcoholism, watches a loving couple from the train...(Jess and Jessie) she's chosen them, their house, because it is directly down the street from her ex-husband and his new wife - the woman he left her for....The storyteller has created quite a loving life for this mystery couple; an artist and a doctor!! Then one day, from her seat on the train, Rachel  witnesses what she believes to be adultery...Cursed with drunken blackout's, curiosity and just bad luck, Rachel awakes one morning, covered in blood, wounds on her body, with no recollection of how she got in this predicament...Rachel finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation...and possibly intimate with the murderer. Interesting, quick read.";Book
"Paula Hawkins knows how to write a good book.  She knows how important it is to produce sentences and paragraphs  to keep the reader turning pages and in this book, the reader must read to the very end of the novel to find our 'Who Done It?""  In this day and time where grammar and punctuation is hardly taught in American high school English Classes, Paula clearly know when to use a comma, colon, or semi-colon.  I find this refreshing that there are writers out there who know how to use these tools.  Sometimes I think editors do not know how to write sentences, use correct punctuation, use the correct tense of a verb and other tools that make reading such a pleasure for one and all.";Book
I just couldn't get into this book at all.  I've picked it up multiple times, and just couldn't do it.  Part of it is the pitiful state of the woman - you could see her total inability to cope right off the bat - but the author beat it to death setting you up to realize she was not going to end up being a credible person when it really mattered.  Frankly I gave up - possibly too early - I suppose eventually she figures out the whole thing and is able to convince the authorities that she really has a clue - BUT I just couldn't bring myself to get to that point.  Bravo for those who were able to finish this book and  thinks it's terrific - I'm not one of them.;Book
"Ms Hawkins has a problem here, but one that the publishers are happy to exploit - Gone Girl.There were always going to be comparisons, but the marketing opportunity was enormous, and it was taken advantage of. In fact, one has to wonder, ""What was the original title of the manuscript?""Standing on its own feet, it's not a bad read. Not the page turner various reviews had me expecting, it plodded along in sections, and wasn't helped by the stilted writing. Trains trundle more than once, sunlight is burnished, knuckles white on wheels... we've all read it more than once.  Given the structure, more adept character development was called for, along with stronger, more distinct voices. It was difficult to invest too much in the main character, and the men came across more as projections than flesh and blood.Having said all that, it would make for a decent read on the train to and from work.Probably safer than looking out the window, in Ms Hawkins' world.";Book
Everyone was talking about “The Girl on the train”. So I hopped on the bandwagon or should I say I hopped on the train too and bought the hard cover, not even the paperback. It seemed interesting about this girl who keeps admiring this couple she sees every day from her train window. It all fell flat…a psychological thriller it should be…I would psychological garbage…. The writer in my view is psychotic…..a lousy story with too much. She kept blacking out and can’t remember anything…too often…really makes no sense.I waste to buy the book and a waste of time on it…writer was just as drunk as Rachel in the story!;Book
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security. Like the slow click of roller coaster wheels climbing up their first steep incline, this book starts slowly, lost in the mind of one woman whose tragic life is submerged in the blurring haze of alcohol where fantasy becomes easily confused with reality and self-pity comes as easily and frequently as fear and doubt. Then, just when the reader is beginning to feel this book might be moving just a little too slow to be worth finishing, the coaster reaches its peak. What follows is a hurtling descent full of twists and turns that will leave you gripping, white knuckled, into the wee hours of the morning.;Book
Not sure what all the fuss is about. It was a good read but not a great read. No one is a good person in this story or who they seem to be on the surface. Except maybe the long suffering roommate. Rachel is in a downward spiral and we are forced to go on the ride. She spots a young couple from her train she takes every day into work. She makes up a life for them, names them and projects her hopes or dashed hopes as it were upon them. Then she finds they are not who she thinks they are. Only they live a few doors down from Rachel's ex and new wife and baby. When the women she has seen from the train goes missing, she can't help but interject herself into the investigation. Rachel thinks she has a clue as to who might have taken her. Only she is a drunk and can't remember what happened that night. Was she there? Takes awhile to find out and when you do, your not too surprised.;Book
"Okay, I can understand how this got to be a best seller. Kudos to Paula Hawkins for writing a hell of good debut novel. I expect to see more from her, though I wouldn't say I'm looking forward to it. The mystery unfolds slowly here but the plot's well crafted, not predictable, tedious or boring. While I was starting to figure it out before the author revealed it, the story was still far more suspenseful than most mysteries. Hawkins is also a very good wordsmith. So why only three stars? Frankly, I found the characters, complex and as well developed as they are, to be just plain depressing. Many reviewers describe the main character, and sometimes a few of the others, as ""unreliable."" I found the book to be full of unpleasant people. Not the kind of people I wanted to spend much time with. No fun at all, so because of the grim people, I'm giving it a grim three stars. Sorry...";Book
Good read, it was difficult to put down. The early part of the book was mostly informational, introducing and defining the 3 main characters. I thought  all 3 were similar in some aspects and had to go back and recall which character I was reading about. This by no means took away from the enjoyment. As I continued to read, the characters became more defined and I could see them as different individuals with some similarities. The longer I read, the harder it became to put down.  Wasn't expecting the ending, but then, isn't that the point of being a good writer!  I am lookig forward to seeing the movie based on this book, it should be intereting!;Book
Well, I read this book in two days, and was sad when I finished.  Not what I expected, but better.  The characters are well developed, but with lots of unexpected twists.  Just when you think you've got a handle on things, you realize you don't!  Not a book to pick up if you don't have time to really jump into it.  The movie is coming out soon, and I'm not sure how I feel about seeing it.  Usually, if its a really good book, I am typically disappointed by the film.  I think I'll see it, though,  just because I enjoyed the plot so much, and Emily Blunt is in it.  I am going to be looking forward to Paula Hawkins next book for sure!  GREAT read!;Book
I do not understand the hype about this book at all.. It was boring and drawn out and I only kept reading it so I could finally find out what happened. And it wasn't even anything crazy or twisted. I won't spoil it for anyone but be prepared to read a bunch of blah blah blah for the first 80% of the book and the blah blah blah didn't need to be said because it didn't make the end better. There was no omg moment. For me anyway. Thats what I was hoping for. And I didn't get it in this book;Book
This is a fun read to do with someone else especially since you can then see the movie and discuss. We both got confused with character and time changes, that caused us to have to pause and review a few times. While some revelations were predictable the collateral damage of the most volatile characters was not always. If you have read the book I wouldn't necessarily say you need to see the movie (unless like me, you were curious to experience another point of view,) however, if you have only seen the movie DO get the book-reading the thoughts of the characters versus watching them - totally different journey;Book
Took some time to untangle characters and story line but was a good read.;Book
"I'm not one to post warnings for books and usually think people old enough to buy adult fiction should be capable of separating fact and fantasy, but this book- wow.. The hype about this novel is everywhere and so many reviewers rave about it,  so- to be honest- I purchased it without really knowing much more than it was about a missing woman, told through the narrative of a woman on the train. This is entirely my responsibility, but this book is hard to read.It is a page turner, to be sure.  I read it over the course of a few days, staying up far later than I should have, and sneaking pages wherever I could. I didn't particularly like it though- there are no sympathetic characters, and I felt vaguely sick each time I read.  I should've seen where it was going before I did.  I guessed early on who the ""bad-guy"" was, but didn't anticipate the level of psychologically terrifying domestic abuse and gas-lighting the author has the men in this novel heap on the 3 female narrators.";Book
I started this book quite a while ago and put it down bc the many characters' narratives were confusing and I got tired of trying to keep them straight. When the movie was announced I decided to give it another try. Once I decided to pay more careful attention to the change in voices and got to know the characters better, I got sucked in so strongly that I couldn't put it down! Another family member had the same experience! Now I'm delighted I gave it a second chance. I must admit to have guessed at the culprit about half way through, but the way that was revealed was terrific. And now I can't wait to see what they do to the story in the movie.;Book
I would not of probably chosen this book but it was given to me in an odd circumstance & I felt compelled to read it. I really enjoyed the way it was written as passages from 3 different woman's views, women, who given a different chance at meeting would of probably been friends.Unfortunately, this is not an option and the book leads you down a path between understanding each woman's motivation for their actions, whilst giving you a unique insight into their choices.The ending is worth the read and you may, as I did equally like the three main characters or have a different opinion. Either way, I recommend this book & if I could share with you the ironic way this book came into my hands, you would probably laugh and understand why I enjoyed out so much.;Book
The book has a good start.  But 3/4 of the way into the book I knew where it was headed. The ending was so/so;Book
Truly, I did not find the main character a very likeable person. Her choices in life behaviors were abhorrent to me.  Not a main character I would like to read about, to get all into her drunken thought processes and behaviors as the book digs deeper.  But, I couldn't extricate myself out of the twists of the story, actually looking forward to the 'alternate person' storylines for something tangible.  While the mystery and writing kept me interested in turning the page (or in my case, the Kindle) and all the elements came together with satisfying answers....I was just left empty, with no real compassion for any of them.  I remember many other books where I find the character(s) so moving in one way or another that I miss them as friends, but when I finished this book, all I felt was relief....so glad I wasn't part of that community or their lives.;Book
I was expecting an exciting novel, but was rather disappointed. All the characters are unbearably uninteresting and, frankly, quite pathetic. The first two thirds of the book are spent detailing the excruciatingly mundane failures of our protagonists, aching for something, anything, interesting to happen.The pace picks up a the end, however the grand reveal is so predictable you lose interest in the story well before the characters become aware of what is going on.The writing is decent, but overall I would not recommend this. There are lots of better novels out there to choose from.Stay away from this one.;Book
The three main female characters were all equally too neurotic. No depth to the characters to distinguish one woman from another. One drank (too much for her to do the actions described in the book) - one haunted by a tragedy but was more interested in controlling men through sex and the other just wanted a house away from the trains. Really? The men - both violent. These typical stereotypes of women and men bring the book down. And the red haired guy on the train- no development on him. He shows up - tells a version of the events and moves on. I would have like to learn more about the two detectives that did the investigation. They needed some personality/personal history not just facial expressions.The story line is very good. I finished the book because I wanted to see how it turned out. But reading the dialogue of those whiny women - was annoying and made the book less interesting. I did learn a few new British terms - thanks for that.;Book
Terrible book, couldn't finish it!;Book
Definitely would read again so twisted! Kept me turning the pages wanting more. I couldn't get to the killer quick enough;Book
I could just never get into it.;Book
good book. i read it fast;Book
This book is a real page turner. But the ending is disappointing. I would still recommend it though if you are looking for something quick and easy to read.;Book
Loved this book!;Book
An amazing, well wrote thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good thriller. Well worth the read!;Book
Ending a little bit unbelievable.  Otherwise suspenseful.  Great character development.  Can't wait to see how movie develops plot and suspense;Book
Great read! Couldn't put it down! So glad I read it before I saw the movie. Definitely recommend reading this one.;Book
Book is awesome!;Book
Rachel is “the girl on the train”.  She spends her days riding to and from London, usually well on her way to drunken oblivion, in an attempt to keep her roommate from realizing she’s been sacked from her job.  As she rides the train, sipping canned gin and tonics, she becomes obsessed with “Jess and Jason”, a couple whose house backs the tracks.  In her mind, she imagines the happy life they lead based on the glimpses she gets as the train trundles past.  At least until she sees Jess kissing another man on her deck.  When Jess goes missing the very next day, Rachel's reality begins to get significantly more complicated.Hawkins does a fantastic job of taking the facts and tearing them to shreds.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you turn the page and poof, your theory implodes.  This is a page-turner that is packed with twists and turns you never see coming.  This is not a beach-read, however.  Make sure you have time to invest if you plan to see it through.;Book
"I hesitated to buy this book due to the recent rash of negative critiques. Don't consider them, this book is a tremendously gripping, suspense filled take on a ""who-done-it"" style of mystery. I read it in 3 days. It flowed well, and the first person style of narration didn't throw me like some books do. I love a character like Rachel, the girl on the train... flawed, yet intriguing. She is like a modern day Bridget Jones in many ways, and the self-effacing manner in which she interacts with the others in her life is both disturbing and endearing. I didn't expect to be so drawn in by this book, so I was pleasantly surprised. American readers should know there is a fair amount of British wording and spelling, (""plaster"" is a band-aid, for example), but this didn't bug me. I would definitely recommend this book if you want to read something that you will enjoy, and something that might just keep you up reading until after 2 a.m.!";Book
I have to admit that I hate books where the MC is a self loathing mess. While I have that out of the way, The Girl on the Train is an interesting read. She takes the story of a pathetic train rider, trying to hide the fact that she lost her job, and weaves it in with the stories of others living nearby. While there is a heroine of sorts, you can't help but shake your head at this collection of warped souls. No one is innocent and everyone has some sort of secret to hide. Although I suspect Paula Hawkins is being a little overly harsh on the human condition, but it is her book to write.It does get a little confusing in some dialogue points where I lost track of who was saying what to whom, but those points were few and far between. The flow was steady and the characters were sufficiently well developed that you felt for them and loathed them at the same time.Overall, a good book. I liked reading it and ultimately felt like it was worth my time and money.;Book
I was a little slow on the uptake realizing there were three different characters telling their stories. Once I got a clue I followed the story line better. The three stories are dated on each of their chapters, but unless you are compulsive about noting the dates, it's a little hard to follow where you are in the action in terms of the time line. Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author.;Book
Really a 2.5 start review.One dimensional characters who, for the most part, I felt no empathy or care for. I understand that sometimes there are flawed characters that are DISTINCTLY flawed but I just really didn't find myself caring for the trio of leading females or their male counterparts. What I did like is the mystery and suspense in this one. While it is a big of a plodding story there were just (and barely that) enough hooks sprinkled into the story to keep me reading a little more otherwise I would have put this down and never picked it back up. In sum though a solid mystery it is really just a middling read with sub par damaged female leads.;Book
The Girl on the Train should not be read on my Kindle.  The chapter headings, providing an orientation to who is narrating and when, are indispensable to following the book, and in my case the essential information was illegible--or maybe I didn't pay attention, until  it was too late.  Also, don't attempt to read this book in fits and starts.  It will be frustrating to figure out who's narrating and when.  There are several narrators, and at least one is unreliable.  None are interesting.I wish writers would notice that drug and alcohol problems have already been written about very comprehensively.  I really am sick of the vomit on the carpet genre.  This books devotes way too much to attention to describing the perils of drinking.I guess the structure and characters are meant to create suspense and mystery, but I found instead confusion and tediousness.;Book
"This book really annoyed me, yet I couldn't stop reading it. The suspense is what kept me going but I really didn't like any of the characters. It's written from the perspectives of Rachel, Megan and Anna and most of it is Rachel, ""the girl on the train"". Rachel is a drunk and I've never dealt with drunk people in real life but just reading about her drunkenness and blackouts exhausted me. This taught me to never read another book if drinking plays any part of the story. When I read mysteries I like to guess all along and try and put the clues together. The problem with this story (without giving things away) is that, the end is not what you expect, simply because the author didn't want you guessing, therefore, the storyline of certain characters completely changes to make sense of it all... When all along, that's not what you were told. I gave the book 4 stars just because it kept me interested, which is hard to do if I don't like ANY of the characters.... I finished the book feeling irritated.";Book
I read the book through and therefore will give it two 1/2 stars.Other than that, with all the publicity hype, I was surprised and disappointed at the quality of the writing, the interminable diary-like entries with the same literary voice, and the tiresome first person present throughout.That the characters are not admirable or don’t experience any semblance of personal growth by the end of the story is not necessarily a criticism. Although I do think some kind of moral reflection makes for a stronger and more memorable protagonist. It’s okay to have the dregs of humanity populate your story, but in this one, they move through it like a bunch of snakes in a pit – not thinking beyond their most primal impulses.I give the writer credit for keeping me reading, having created a certain amount of tension and suspense.  But then I take it back for letting me down in the end.  I wanted to care about Rachel, Anna and Megan but in the end all I wanted to do was be rid of them and their tedious soliloquies.;Book
The novel is written with the interesting strategy of moving from the mind of one woman to another of the three whose lives are intertwined in unfortunate ways.  I was confused by that at first and couldn't get a sense of what was going on or how I was supposed to interpret this.  But in time, the connection of each to the others began to gel and then I was in.  The characters are interesting and dark in different ways and the actions of each has affected the lives of the other two in devastating ways although none of them knows the others very well.  The suspense grows toward the end as you begin to realize that you're finally going to find out just who did what and the climax was riveting.  I wouldn't have recommend it while reading the first several chapters but I hung with it and I'm glad I did.  Worth reading and the story continues to haunt me a little bit days later after finishing it.;Book
I actually bought this book back last year. I tried to read it a couple of times but just couldn't get into it. Well now that they've made a movie out of it I figured I needed to try again. So, I plunged in. I've read other books like this one where it's really a slow moving book, they just don't keep my attention. I'm giving it three stars just because others must have seen something good in it in order to make a movie from it. Even though I finished it I'm sorry but I just wouldn't recommend reading it. I know there are others that I'm sure loved it, but I love murder mysteries and this one is just too slow moving for me.;Book
Since the novel was proclaimed as the next Gone Girl, I was eager to get started since I loved that book. Rather than a real psychological thriller, it turned out to be a regular who dun it..not the type of literature that I typically enjoy.Although there was an interesting mix of women, all who were suffering in some way because of motherhood, some of the sections seemed to drag on and on.As the author portrayed the alcoholic binges of the main character, I believe that she wanted us, too, caught in the downward spiral.  That worked the first one of two times around, but then became a drudge to read.If the who dun it genre is your reading style, you will probably enjoy it.  For me, it was just okay.;Book
Omgosh--definitely the page-turner. An hour on gym treadmill literally flew by while reading this book. Really exciting psychothriller type story, with multiple POVs... can't wait to see the feature film. Apparently actress Rebecca Ferguson of the awesome new Mission Impossible is going to star, alongside the very talented actress Emily Blunt. This book really isn't like Gone Girl, per se, except in the sense that someone is murdered and it is a thrilling fiction read... as this book is quite mysterious until near the end (with GG, you know pretty quick that the wife is a crazy-arse beeyatch who is framing her hubbers) as you don't really know who did the deed. Also, this story is a full-on ensemble piece. Omgosh, know that I'm gushing but this is a book to re-read and can't wait to see the film. Hope the author writes more thrillers, will definitely read. Happy reading~*;Book
I'd heard so much upbeat comments about Girl On The Train, that I had to try it.  I'd ridden on trains in England 12 years ago and enjoyed it immensely watching the countryside and seeing the backs of little houses and their yards. I can see the pull of this context of a disturbed and very hurt girl losing herself in the same views from the train day by day.  In some ways it was a very intriguing story, but for me there has to be at least one character I want to pull for....cheer on...see him or her through to the end.  In this book there were no such characters that I latched onto and committed to and worried about. Every character in this story was someone to worry about...and many had very dark undercurrents pulling and pushing them to sordid doings.  So, yes, I did finish it and gladly put it down.  It was not uplifting, but if you like dark, sad, depressing mysteries then this is your cup of tea. Everyone to his own taste. See Gee;Book
I am not going to bother to run a synopsis of the book, you can already see that in the description in the listing.  I am so enjoying this book and I am only through the first 80 pages or so.  I am actually reading a bit at a time because I want it to last, LOL  The characters as well as, the plot-line, are very well written.  I was drawn into the story and involved by the first few pages.  For me, that is the hallmark of a very, very good read.You become the characters, you live their lives, feel for them, dislike them, and cheer then on.  Also, as a Brit, the authors  description of all things British are spot on!;Book
For me this was a GREAT read.  I enjoyed every moment of life within the lives of its characters.  The author reveals events, feelings and interchanges of the characters at a steady pace holding my attention and wanting to read on.  Chapter lengths were the same way. I related to the main character as I have had a drinking problem and experiences many of the same feelings and decisions as she did.  I hope I can now enjoy the movie more from reading the novel and if  it  dose not compare positively I will enjoy thinking about the differences and relive the pleaseant experience of  reading the book.;Book
"A sad joke concerning those who are substance abusers asks ""How can you tell an addict is lying?"" Answer: ""His/her lips are moving."" Really not funny, but it supports a basic tenet of this book: every character is a liar. Most of the story is told from the point of view of a severe alcoholic, who looks into the homes of people whose houses are near the railroad tracks of the train she is on. She invents stories about their lives in between her drunken stupors. One day a murder occurs involving one of the people she watches; she decides to try to solve the murder on her own after lying to the police, making up her own story of what she believes happens. No spoiler alert here about what happens and who's involved. Suffice to say, the title of the book is a bit misleading: when I saw ""girl"", I thought the book would feature a young girl and her adventures on a train as it crosses the English countryside. Reading about a whino whose husband dumped her is not my cup of tea.";Book
I was fairly entertained by this book. Nice twist at the end. Got a little long in the middle with the unreliable narrator, Rachel, and her going on and on about the same things. Anna and Megan were just annoying sometimes. My basic problem with this book is the lack of someone to really root for. I had the same problem with Gone Girl. I didn't like any of the characters enough to truly feel invested in them. Although I liked the 'just desserts' for one of the baddies in the end. That was satisfying. I liked this book well enough to keep reading. Maybe I was a bit underwhelmed because I expected more with all the hype about it. I'd give it 3.5 stars.;Book
"""The Girl on the Train"" definitely had it's ups and downs. The main character - an alcoholic spending half the book in a drunken stupor - was infuriating, frustrating, and downright depressing. There were times where I felt truly sad for her, and others where I rolled my eyes at her terrible decision making. There are only a few characters in this novel at all, and none of them are likable. The plot had a lot of promise, though the end was more of an over-dramatized Lifetime movie and less ""Gone Girl"". It was a fun read, but nothing that shines in terms of mind-blowing twists and turns or characterization.";Book
"I have heard the characters were all mental cases - yep to some degree they were.  A girl with a vivid imagination watched homes and the people who lived there from the train every day. Imagining their lives as stable, peaceful, loving, she couldn't have been further from the truth.  As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.  The surprise ending was handled very well by the author. I have a lot of responsibilities, so I am not one to read a book through at one sitting; therefore when I would have to take care of duties, my mind was constantly on the book, wondering, wondering - what next!  Good book and it would have been a real page turner if I had the ability to do that.  Really loved the way it was put together, with chapters on the main female characters. Really enlightened the understanding!";Book
I liked the story although it took a while for me to get interested.  I am not a fan of the journal type of writing.  I did not care for it in Gone Girl, and I prefer a story that is written in the first person.  However, that being said, I'm not sure how the suthor could have written this novel in any other fashion than the way she did.  I alternated feeling angry and sympathetic to Rachel.  She was her own worst enemy.  She did so many things without thinking through what the ramifications of her actions might be.  You just wanted to shake her to wake her up.  I am very interested in seeing how the movie handles the characters of this novel.;Book
Read this book in a day! It's a true page-turner. Similar to Gone Girl, but BETTER! Way better! Highly recommend!;Book
Thrilling and interesting. Grwat read;Book
Held my interest.;Book
Based on the reviews of The Girl on the Train, I was anticipating a well written psychologically sound thriller. Right up my alley. But no, it was a dead end. I found the dialogue tedious. The plot lacked intricacy. The women - Rachel, Anna and Megan - were drunk, depressed and disappointed while the men lacked credibility. I read the whole book. I've never before written a book review but have read and depended on many, so I felt I owed to potential readers to share my negative opinion.;Book
Great read!! Better than Gone Girl. Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.;Book
I have trouble staying interested in a lot of books, but this one definitely held my attention. I highly recommend it!;Book
I need this book for this weekend ?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!??!! ThaT'S WHY I PAY EXTRA DAMN??!?!??!?!??!?!;Book
they werre all different;Book
One of the stupidest books I've ever read - not sure why this author even bothered -;Book
This book is a real thriller. It has a slow start and quickly became a page-turner. Definitely recommend!;Book
I've heard so much about this book and was excited to give it a read, but was seriously disappointed once I read it. The ending was easily predictable and it started out very slow. However, I ended up reading the entire thing to make sure I wasn't missing anything and to say that I read it. I personally wouldn't recommend it, but I know others who really enjoyed the book.;Book
I loved this book, and couldn't put my Kindle down while I was reading it. I thought the approach was fresh, and for me at least, not predictable.  I liked the author's style in releasing information a bit at a time rather than revealing everything all at once.  I had heard so much about the film that it made me curious about the book, so I decided to read it before I saw the movie.  I still haven't seen it, and heard it's not as good as the book, but I think few films ever are.  This is not the type of book I'm usually attracted to, but I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience.;Book
I was sooo excited to read this book after all of the great things I heard about it.  It took me a couple of tries before I was in the right frame of mind to read it.  For me, there was too much of the book wrapped up in how drunk and miserable she was.  This part got old fast and made the story drag on.  I guessed who the villain was way before the end of the book.  I think I would have liked it more if the main character, Rachel, would have made more attempts to improve herself throughout the story, even as she was embroiled in her obsession.  Her pathetic nature just kind of overshadowed the whole book for me.;Book
My curiosity was piqued by this novel upon seeing it at the bestseller list for quite a while, at the same time I was quite skeptic as to how this could be such a bestseller.With the first few pages I was drawn to Rachel's life and how during her daily train travel to and from her new home she would watch her previous home and her past wonderful life at the same time admiring the couple three houses down. She has in her mind that they are happy - Jess and Jason was what she named them. Then suddenly things are not what they are.I loved the switching of point of views. At the same I wanted to shake Rachel to tell her to stop drinking, stop with those bloody black outs, I wanted to know what she saw/remembered. The Girl On A Train is engrossing and will keep you guessing. I did not see it coming and at the same time toward the end of the book, I was like - why is my least favorite character involved...what...and then I went oh...I get it now.;Book
Too slow. It requires a lot of patience. Style of writing makes it further boring . Could have used direct method of story telling and should have made it a thriller easily. Though story line is good and convincing yet does not make an absorbing reading.;Book
This book is terrific from 1st page to the last!!! The characters are so well developed, and the author switches from one to the other very smoothly. The main character is a woman named Rachel, and it is she who rides the train everyday, giving the reader a bird's eye view of what she sees, and what she imagines about the people that she sees everyday. Her imagination takes over reality, but we soon find out that the real lives of these people are much worse than what she imagined for them. We also get to know Rachel, and all about her sad battle with alcohol, and also her ex-husband and his new wife, who are prominent characters in the book. The book is never boring, and these people are so interesting, and so complex, that you just feel compelled to keep reading. It is definitely thrilling, and the moodiness of the grey weather in England is the perfect background for the story.;Book
Wonderful British murder mystery but more than that, the protag is a drunk, something we don't see much in novels. She is struggling with alcoholism and her credibility is compromised. I loved this twist.TGOTT is a murder mystery that takes place in the suburbs of London England. A woman who's been replaced by her husband (in his life and their house) notices the neighbors from the train and becomes engrossed in their affairs. It's a case of voyeurism and more.The novel is written beautifully, flawlessly. The mystery is compelling with the author feeding us just the right amount of information about each character to let us think they could've been the killer. Well done.;Book
"The Girl On The Train is a well-crafted, suspense novel told from the perspective of three very different women.  It is full of plot twists and turns and unpredictable until the very end.  Although the storyline is quite depressing, the well-developed characterizations of Rachel, Megan and Anna are realistic enough to elicit sympathy and caring concern.  The women are all flawed, as are the male characters, who are all damaged in one way or another.  The underlying theme seems to be:  ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.""  Our view of life can often be deceptive, since things aren't always what they appear to be, as Rachel eventually learns from her view on the train.  The final resolution  and conclusion were well thought out and perfect!  Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer with considerable insight into the psychological, narcissistic workings of the human mind.  Her debut novel is riveting, memorable and not to be missed.";Book
"""The Lorien Legacies"" are a continuing book in the ""Pitticus Lore"" series that began with ""I Am Number Four"" (which was the best of the lot. I have not yet read ""The Light Between Oceans: because after the first few pages, I found that the subject matter (stealing a child by a woman who could not have her own) was more sad than dramatic. ""The Girl on the Train"" was well-written, but there were too many plot twists that really strained credibility and it portrayed women as weak and virtually helpless without a man in their life. I found that point of view disturbing.";Book
This would probably be considered a psychological thriller, and that it was indeed.  I never guessed what was coming until almost the end of this novel.  The characters were well-developed with great description and  excellent expression of their thoughts and feelings.  The story is told primarily from one person's point of view, but several characters, especially the other two main female characters, also weigh in and add to understanding the story. It is set in London, and the regular commuter train running through the story ties all the characters and settings together.  There is a strong message that you can never fully know what another person's life is like despite how things may seem. It is a creative and absorbing story that was impossible to put down once I got into it.  Highly recommend!;Book
Intriguing;Book
Absolutely LOVED this book  Amazing beginning to end.  Now I need to see the movie!;Book
Great story!;Book
Loved it ( much better than the Movie Version );Book
Girl on a train did not get downloaded onto my kindle. Can you help?;Book
"Sorry, but this definitely is not up to the standard of ""Gone Girl"" or Hitchcock!  The main character is not at all likeable nor sympathetic.  Her self-destructive behavior becomes repetitious and boring.  The ending is predictable and unoriginal, like a B movie.  Don't waste your time.";Book
Couldn't put it down!;Book
Maybe I was expecting too much based on all of the hype.  I was disappointed.;Book
The story itself did not match up to the write up about it. It was lackluster, I did not identify with the main protagonist who maintains an alcoholic stupor pretty much throughout the story. The ending was just awful. If I wanted to suspend reality throughout the entire book I would read fantasy or sci fi, not fiction.Don't waste your money!;Book
Such. A. Great. Read.;Book
. . . is that it gets you deeply into situations when you have only a small understanding or even a BIG MISUNDERSTANDING of what is really going on.  This situation gets even more complicated when the misunderstandings are multiplied by three different narrators, Rachel, Megan, and Anna, each with her own assumptions and misunderstandings about the other two.  And when one is an alcoholic (not recovering, unfortunately), and the other two are seductresses caught in love triangles with one another’s husbands, friends, and therapists, then it gets really complicated trying to figure out what’s real and what was only imagined or misunderstood.  That this entire narration is so interesting, really so captivating, is to the credit of author Hawkins’ considerable skills.  Not a comic, but a tragic tale, and well worth the time.;Book
"I usually read Sci-Fi and Fantasy, with quick jumps into literature and non-fiction for a break to get an idea of what is happening in the literary world.Didn't know what to expect with this book, but the idea of unreliable narrator is always fascinating; and this book pulls it off with great aplomb.The pathos that the author is able to generate for the 'main' narrator (there are three viewpoints in this book') is impressive. I actually felt sorry and disgusted for her, in equal parts.Caveat : I never liked Ignatius in Confedarcy of Dunces, just didn't do it for me - but this worked.It's a gripping read, fast paced. Just a really well told yarn.And if, IF, anyone cares, yes, the three viewpoints are all female; but this is in no way a 'female' oriented book. It is just a good story, told in an interesting way";Book
This was a pretty good story, the author didn't leave any loose ends open. It was a little bit predictable though. I had an idea of what would happen in the end, and I was mostly right. It definitely keeps you glued to those pages though. The characters aren't really at all like able. Rachel is just a sad mess. Megan is very unfaithful, although I did feel a little sympathetic towards her for certain reasons that you'll find out if you read it. Anna just seemed so whiny and just basically did everything Tom told her to do. No mind of her own almost. This is definitely worth reading though if you're into thriller/murder type books. I'll be excited to see the movie when it's released!;Book
"This is a book i can see becoming a made for TV movie one of these days starring Tori Spelling.  It reads just like a movie, building suspense the entire book until you finally found out who the killer was at the very end, with a nice unexpected twist.  You spend the entire book thinking that every character could've done it.  The book is a pretty fast read once you get into it, which is nice, if you are looking for that.  What bothered me was the main character, i did not find her likable and most of the time pretty downright annoying.  I wanted to shout at her ""get your s**t together!!"".Overall it's an entertaining book, my book club gave it mixed reviews, so i wouldn't necessarily tell anyone not to read it, i'm just not going to rave about it.  If you like a good ""who done it?"" type book that is a fast read, then this one could be for you.  I love a good murder mystery, but i need a little more.";Book
"Rachel takes the same commuter train every morning and night! Every day she rattles down the track.  She watches the cozy homes and sees the same couple daily and has even started to feel like she knows them.  Their life-as she sees it is perfect, not unlike the life she recently lost. And then she sees something shocking and becomes entangled in the investigation and the lives of everyone involved.When I first began to read Girl on a Train, I found it dark and depressing.  I put it down several times as I could not become interested in the daily train rides and I found myself asking, ""Is this all there is?"" As I read through the first chapters, however, I became spellbound and couldn't wait to read on.  The story keeps you on the edge with riveting tales of intimacy and betrayal.  The characters are well-developed.  One feels a combination of emotions for Rachel including pity, empathy, disgust, and admiration.  I didn't want the book to end!";Book
"The beginning of this book was very slow and even towards the end it wasn't very exciting. When the book finally climaxed, it was good however I feel as though it wasn't good enough. The very ending of the book for Rachel was disappointing; during the climax of the books she became so strong but the ending described her as essentially the same person before a tragic situation - the only difference her being 20 days sober.. the previews for the movie over the novel and the description about the book really lead me to believe this book would be very exciting which sadly it didn't meet expectations...";Book
This book was a quick read, it pulled me in almost immediately and did not let me go until I finished. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the novel that gives you the feeling that you are talking to an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, one who saw you through some difficult times. I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad. You immediately feel bad for her and as you delve further into the story you realize just how pathetic she is. None of the characters are particularly happy or well-rounded people, the women in this story lead especially depressing lives.;Book
"Lives up to most of the hype it has been given. And I don't say that very often when it comes to bestsellers.If I only have one criticism of the novel, it is this: the author plays with our minds a little too long and some of the suspense began to wane (for me,at least). If perhaps she would have pointed me in the direction of the killer, a little earlier, and showed the minds of the other suspects (that we all contemplated) just a little sooner, I for one would have been happier. There did come a point where both my wife and I - we read it aloud to one another - were like ""get on with it, we're ready for a climax here.""Believe it or not, there were a few grammatical mistakes (IMHO). My daughter found them as well. Otherwise it is a good quick read. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes mystery and suspense.";Book
If you're looking for a book that sets women back decades, if not centuries, this is a winner. Written from the perspective of 3 women, there isn't a single characteristic of any of these characters that women should be proud of. None of  the female characters have anything going on outside of the men in their lives. As Paula Hawkins tells it, all members of the female sex are unfaithful, useless, unambitious, jealous alcoholics defined solely by their ability to procreate. Meanwhile, men are just for being disloyal.The author has so much disdain for women, she can't even be bothered to call us women in the title. Instead, we're just girls.Please don't perpetuate this shallow view of women by spending a dime on this book.;Book
Slow build up to a predictable and terrible ending. The ending was wrapped up so fast and easy that it left me angry. Plus, I don't think some characters would act the way they did in the ending. I don't understand why the author included some items detail throughout the book and never made them relevant.Overall, this book had me interested and I liked the format, but it only let me down completely. Who wraps up a story like this in a few paragraphs?;Book
Go on to amazon.co.uk and read the book's reviews there for a more accurate take on the book.This is not a thriller. During the first 70% of the book this is an examination of the angst suffered by three unlikable middle class British housewives The plot is wafer thin and is presented via exposition and resolution in the last 10% of the book. If you are looking for the next Gone Girl, keep looking;Book
I was recommended this book from Buzfeed's article about books with plot twists. Plot twists, this book did deliver, but all the action is in the last hundred or so pages....all pages  before hand are so much of Rachel drinking, either puking or crying, forgetting what she's doing or has done....just over and over. It got old after a while. Once the plots twists finally came, it did get exciting and I will admit I was shocked and surprised. I ended up appreciating 2 characters I loathed in the beginning. I would've  rated this higher if Rachel weren't so hard follow and hard to *want* to be on her side.;Book
"I absolutely loathe having to push myself to finish a book and that is exactly what this book is forcing me to do.  I'm sad and annoyed that I spent the money on this one, which is why I feel the need to read to the end.  All of the characters are annoying, thin, shallow, and fairly bland.  The main character is amazingly stupid with her constant whining about messing up and then doing the same things over and over.  The worst part is having to read the same scenes and thoughts repeatedly . . . talk about boring!  I saw the ending after the first couple of chapters, but kept telling myself ""no, this has to get better than that!""  It didn't.  I'm honestly surprised and appalled that so many people enjoy this book.  It's nothing new or interesting past the free preview section, in fact it's just more of the same contrived garbage all the way to the obvious and bland ending.  Where are the good and enjoyable novels anymore?  Not here, I can promise you that!";Book
I am not into murder-mystery books. At all.I cringe at the suggestion of them. Just not my thing.However, I kept seeing this book at the top of the lists and it had over 500 hold requests at the library--so of course, I had to read it. There must be a reason it's so poplar, right?I got the Kindle sample but it wasn't enough. So I bought the full version and, well, it sucked me in. At first because I could relate to Rachel. Then the story started to unfold and things were twisting and turning and I simply could NOT stop reading.I suspected one person for the better part of the book, then another, butNever who it turned out to be, although thinking back, there were plenty of clues.The author did an amazing job with this! I'm impressed!Normally I am not happy with the way these books end, but I was actually pleased with this one. I felt peaceful about it.Good read. Highly recommended!;Book
"The book has a strong plot. If you like mysteries, I recommend it. It moves along at a steady pace and has an interesting style: It is written from the point of view of primarily three women, mostly two. Early on the voices of these women were quite different, but as the book progressed it got harder and harder to distinguish them, which might have been intentional. I didn't know ""who did it"" until it was revealed, so kudos to the author for that. My main complaint is that I didn't find any of the characters likeable, but that might be less of an issue in the movie (I love Emily Blunt).";Book
A murder mystery with twists and turns reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Rachel, an unemployed, alcoholic divorced woman, rides the train pretending to go to work every day in order to keep her unemployment a secret from her landlord / roommate.  Every day the train stops at a signal, where Rachel people watches and makes up imaginary scenarios for a couple that lives in a home across the tracks.  One day Rachel sees something shocking and decides that what she has seen will help solve the disappearance / murder mystery of the woman she has been watching from the train.  The police, understandably, do not find Rachel a credible witness.  She becomes increasingly, obsessively involved in this mystery.  Told through the voices of the different characters in the story, jumping back and forth in time, this story is engaging and well written.  I enjoyed it very much.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I figured out the end of the mystery about 3/4 into the book.;Book
"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.  It is a true ""who done it"" - and I was surprised.  Had some theories through the whole book but they were knocked away.";Book
Many suspenseful events in this novel that it was difficult to predict until the very end.  The main character Rachel, seemingly simple and bored  is actually quite complex.  She had many emotional problems of her own creation, so it was difficult to understand her behavior and whyshe continually made poor choices.  This developed a love/hate relationship for her character.  A good read!!;Book
"finally gave in & bought this book because of the reviews & popularity. It certainly is a page turner but I felt uncomfortable & uneasy thru the whole book. I wanted to shout at Rachel aren't the words ""no"" or ""appropriate"" in your vocabulary? Anna was truly evil & Megan was somewhat of a loose cannon. The men were awful, how could 2 such alike persons live doors away from each other & be involved with the same 3 woman. The set up of the book, days divided into morning & evening was alright but in some cases the story went back in time & had me very confused.  I'm not sorry I read this book, it just left me with some morbid feelings. Not scared, just creepy-like every noise in the house made me jump. Would i recommend this book to anyone? If you enjoy reading & experiencing different scenarios go for it. But read it real fast, very easy to do, & have another book to delve into right away so those creepy feelings don't stay with you.";Book
"I found the first 70 pages quite boring and had a hard time getting into this book, but I began to like it a bit more as it progressed. It may be confusing at first because the story is told from different narrative points of view, three to be exact, and because it is not written in linear or chronological order; it goes from present to past and back again, so the reader has to look at both the date and the name at the beginning of each chapter to ascertain from whose point of view the chapter is being told and when the events occurred. The three main female characters are not very likeable and have unpleasant characteristics throughout the book; however, they become more likeable at the end which is the best part of the entire book. It dragged at times, and I wasn't really engaged in it during most of the book, but once I got into it, I wanted to finish it.";Book
I liked the way the described the feelings of each of the female characters, you can see traits of yourself in each one of them, they are so realistic.I would mainly recommend this book to women, men may find it hard to connect with, since it has got a female point of view.I gave it a 5 stars rating cos I found it very well written, and although it is a fiction novel, you get. So mucho involved in the plot.;Book
"I was hooked after the first page...and because I was stuck on an airplane going overseas I read the book straight through.  I loved the development of the story..good character development for this type of genre and the story was very clever and fresh.  It definitely had that familiar GONE GIRL suspense element that draws the reader through the book ""looking"" for answers.  I felt that the story was well crafted, did not give hints about the ""truth"" for at least three quarters of the book, adding doubts and twists along the way so the reader is not really certain until almost the end what really happened.I would absolutely recommend this book as a fast read, one that you really can't wait to get back to reading. I sort of hated for it to end because I was rooting for the main character and was curious about what was going to happen to her...but was glad to finally have closure on the story.";Book
"Thin, repetitive storyline. We've heard this plot before -- but never as poorly executed. The characters, dialogue and premise is a huge cliche. It's sort of like a British Desperate Housewives of classless losers on Blenheim Road -- except the TV show, Desperate Housewives, was inventive, clever and entertaining in its tongue-in-cheek comedy/drama/mystery. Here, everyone on Blenheim Road has a secret ugly scheme.The characters are one dimensional, boring and any reveals are trite and telegraphed long before you read them. Despite the fact that Rachel and Anna constantly and intensely clash throughout the entire book, here's a revelation that Rachel has in the last quarter of the book: ""Something's not right and I can't shake the feeling that it has to with Anna.""  Really? Ya think?? How did this book get so many thousands of 4 & 5-star reviews?? Something's not right -- for sure.";Book
I was very engaged in reading The Girl On the Train!  It drew me in immediately through its tone and setting. I wanted to find out more about this girl on the train. What did she see? Why was she on the train?  The tone was mysterious and I wanted to know why!I was drawn to Rachel's pain. I couldn't imagine why she sought such relief through her drinking. What kind of pain drove her to seek out oblivion.  The description of her drinking was well done.  Her pain is palpable, you can almost taste her drinks and you can almost feel her hangovers.A painful tale of hurt and deception and ultimately triumph I believe.There was unfinished ideas that kept me from five stars. It left some significant holes that needed closure.;Book
confusing characters..movie prefers don't appeal to me either..would not recommend this book..i am an avid reader and just finished the book because it have been on best seller list for so long..thought it would get betterb. crane;Book
I found the main character, Rachel, so pathetic at first that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this book.  Since it was was selected by our book club, I pushed myself to keep reading.  It did get better but was pretty predictable. The story is about a women who watches a couple from the morning train while she commutes into London.  She watches them out on their back patio and has made up fictional names and fictional lives for them.  One day she sees something that doesn't look right to her and this puts her in a tailspin.  Her ex-husband happens to live a few doors down from this couple with his new wife that he left Rachel for in her old house.  This complicates things because she cannot let go of the fact that she is still in love with her ex so she ends up stalking him which puts her in a position to stalk the other couple as well.  There are lots of twists to the story but I saw a lot of them coming before they happened.;Book
"Well, I just wanted to write a review that would've helped me if I had seen it before reading this book...If you're bored and need something to do, read it, but it's not as notable as the hype was all about. It was slow and the only great part was the end, not the ending though. It all builds up to one point, and you have to struggle to get there. The lives are intertwined very unrealistically and everyone is painted as the ""bad guy"". I do like the view of the book through an alcoholic, it adds a different feel and makes you doubt what you are reading. This book does not compare AT ALL to Gone Girl. Not even close.";Book
I really enjoyed reading this book.  My sister loaned me her audio copy but, I had a hard time staying focused on it.  I gave it back to her and bought it so I could read it.  It was much better for me to read it, I think because of how she changes the perspective from one character to another, it was easier for me to follow the written version.  I have bought another hard copy to give as a gift.;Book
I liked the idea of the book but not the complete execution.  It's difficult for the reader to really like or relate to any of the characters.  Although I did feel like the descriptions of Rachel's battle with alcohol to be sometimes somewhat compelling.  I really did feel her want/need for a drink.The reader is trying to figure out 'who done it?' BUT the author did not really give us enough clues for us to have any idea what she had in mind. I partially understand that is because we are supposed to be seeing through the eyes of the various characters but I felt as if I wanted a little more depth and nuance that would clue us in (ever so slightly) as to what the endgame would be.  When things become apparent, I was surprised but didn't feel enough excitement for the 'AH-HA' moment.  I felt like I was kind of cheated by being completely blinded from all of what was really going on.;Book
I bought this book for my wife, and she has had nothing but good words for it. She has tried a number of times to get me to read it and I'm sure one of these days I will. We have the Kindle version so unless we lose our e-reader the book will always be available. My eysight is bad so I am subscribed to a Talking Library organization and they recently sent me a recorded version of the book. If they have it in their collection it has to be a good book. Doing this review has brought the book to the top of my list of things to do so I have to get started on it. Book reviews and my wife highly recommend this book so I would say get it, and enjoy!  JLM;Book
"It was terrible.  The two main female characters Rachel/Megan were consistently unlikeable.  No redeeming qualities.  Hard to stay with a story when you don't like the characters. The story line was confusing, ""is she lying"" or ""isn't she"".  That got old. When it could be followed, it was uninteresting.  I gave up a little past half way and skipped to the end due to a book club review.  All of my book club felt the same, and we rarely agree.  ""Best seller"" because large numbers of people were buying it under the premise that being on ""the best seller"" list means it is well written.  Not so.";Book
I hate books and movies where all the suspense is created by the narrator being an idiot, making avoidable mistakes. This tale is told by a drunk who creates all of her own problems and whose myriad mistakes made while hammered are only reason book isn't 50 pages long. I figured out who did it pretty early on, which is not to say im that smart, but that this book is that unsmart. It is similar to gone girl in that it's an unreliable narrator situation (which seems to be the only way that anyone can write an interesting suspense novel these days).  Not hitchcockian in the least----pretty TV movie. This is a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on Gillian Flynn's writing style,  but not well-written or sufficiently entertaining for me to read the remaining third. Save your money and your time---I wish I had.;Book
I truly hated this book...annoying character who kept getting drunk...just plain uninterested in what happened to anybody.  I CANNOT understand the popularity unless we are a truly dumbed down audience or the marketing department is very very good.....There are so many wonderful books out there, don't waste your time.;Book
This book was such a disappointment.  80% of the book was a page turner written by a gifted writer. However the conclusion is so juvenile one would think you were reading a 15 year old's high school assignment. The literary quality of the book completely fell apart at the end.;Book
Although Ms. Hawkins' writing style is engaging and original, I found the story to be overly gruesome and the turn of events unbelievable.  None of the characters were likable - there was no one to root for - and I grow ever more tired of stories about people whose only concerns are getting laid and ruining their health one way or another.  This will perhaps make a mildly diverting made-for-TV movie one day, but steer clear otherwise.;Book
"I have to say, I found this book depressing, boring in some spots, and hard to read. I grew up with an alcoholic mother, so this was tough reading. for me.The story keeps switching around the 3 ladies in the book and it got tough staying on point. I agree with a few reviewers that Anna and Megan should have been built up more, although this book was all about Rachel.Rachel in an alcoholic and has a 'black night' of drinking and the entire book works around, ""What happen that night."" It was a good mystery because I never guessed who the killer was until the end of the book. But getting to the end was tough. You have to pay attention to dates and who is talking to even figure out what is going on.Reading fiction is supposed to take you away and be relaxing. This is not that kind of book. I'm not sure I even know what happens to Rachel, I was so caught up in trying to figure who was telling the story in this book. For me, it just solved the mystery, but I didn't feel that the story of Rachel ended. Maybe it was just me.Even though most reviewers have reviewed this book above 3, I would not recommend it. It was not a pleasant experience for me. Please understand it could be because of the alcoholism, that isn't a pleasant memory, and it took me back there. I only bought this book because of the +20 thousand people who reviewed the book. I know more than that have read it, and for me, I wonder why?";Book
On the plus side while I could put this book down I did feel a compelling need to go back and finish it.  There is an engaging mystery and a truly scary climax.  Three stars for that.On the minus side--the three main characters are women who in a sense are clones of each other--totally focused on the man in their lives and on actual or wished for children.  No careers, no quirks.  Weak and drippy.  The overall mood of the book is depressing.  When these characters did something strong it was either recklessly stupid or out of character.There is also the Agatha Christie cliché of the culprit at the end spilling the beans about what really happened while someone is (figuratively) tied to the railroad tracks.  That was old with Agatha Christie.The originality and unique take on contemporary life that you'll find in Gone Girl is simply not here, plus the whole view of life and women's lives in particular is just a downer.  The writing is okay but the three narrators all are alike in how they express themselves.;Book
WAS THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!So many lost opportunities, a poor plot line and NO twist or connection in the end between the characters:Tom? what? who cares about that guy. He gives his story up so easily in the end, really? he doesn't even transform as a character before that.What happened to all of the pieces of clothing that Rachel sees on her trips? that provides suspense in the beginning but means nothing.The ENTIRE story about Megan really doesn't mean anything - in the end, it doesn't even matter that she had/killed a baby (it doesn't even have anything to do with her death), the dr. Abdul guy storyline is a total waste.Scott is the lousiest character ever - what is the whole end fight with Rachel for?And Anna just puts her girl to bed and has a beer when Tom is confessing? lamewhat about the guy with the red hair?;Book
I'm actually surprised that this book is as popular as it is, when there are so many good ones out there right now.  I've seen this book compared to Gone Girl, and I don't understand because while it has a similar premise, (missing girl, murder, intrigue) it was entirely less interesting and surprising, although I will admit that The Girl on the Train did keep me in suspense for the first half.  It seemed like the author had a great idea with a girl on a train, studying people's lives as she passed by, but then it got muddled by a bunch of affairs and entirely too attractive people.Ultimately I was rooting for this book to be better, but the characters were not relatable or realistic in my opinion, and it seemed like I was watching a soap opera.;Book
My book club selected this book.  I wasn't even half way through and had to torture myself to finish it.  Very slow moving, somewhat predictable, with characters in bad places who are so unlikeable that you can't even feel sympathy for them.  Too many people making bad, selfish, stupid choices which will lead them to the inevitable.  The train rides take up a large portion of the story, which was mostly dull. I could not in good conscience recommend this book to anyone.;Book
I wanted to like this book. I did. But it was SO morose and depressing. It was horrible go through the main characters alcoholism with her. Perhaps that is a credit to the author. I had figured out who had done it about half way through. Initially I was totally confused as to whose voice I was reading and had to go back and read again. I just wasn't paying attention to the chapter titles. By the end I felt myself thinking that that was a very depressing trip without a lot of excitement. I mean I read the whole thing. It was okay. Not sure what the hype is all about.;Book
A cleverly constructed story written from the perspectives of the three main female characters, Rachael, Megan, and Anna.  Rather than numerical chapters, each chapter is named for whomever happens to be telling the story from their point of view at the time.  This transforms into a gripping and exciting yarn about love found, then tragically lost.  It touches upon the insidious and hopeless consequences of alcoholism, infidelity, and ultimately cold and calculated murder.  This is not a happy story with a fairytale ending.  It left me feeling glad it was over but satisfied I stayed with it.;Book
"I have never understood the fascination with books about mentally unstable protagonists. Personally Like with ""Gone Girl"" I find it very hard to either connect or sympathise with these unstable and very often unpleasant characters. The drunken heroine never really grows or develops beyond the initial introduction and she is just boring by the end of the novel. The fact that the second wife turns out to be as unstable as her does nothing to mitigate the boredom, in fact you just begin to wonder if there are any normal people in this fictional world or if everyone is determined to be dysfunctional.";Book
A very good read. Story is told by three female characters. Mood is ominous all through the book. Rachel is the main character. She is divorced from her husband who has remarried and has a daughter with his new wife Anna. Rachel is not able to accept her changed situation even though she initiated the divorce when she caught her husband red-handed with Anna. The marriage was falling apart even before as Rachel was not able to conceive. Rachel takes a train every day to London even though she has lost her job there. She watches her old house and a neighbor's from the train. She is able to observe what is going on the porches of these home. The couple in the neighboring house seem to be greatly in love until one day Megan the wife is found murdered. Murderer's identity remains secret almost until the end.;Book
I found this to be a solid, enjoyable thriller. The story is told in the first person by the three female protagonists. One of the threads is deferred significantly in time. This structure works quite well to produce the suspense on which the success of this type of narrative depends. It perhaps falters a little however in its depiction of the male characters. We see then through the women’s eyes but really don’t get enough food for thought about them to enable us to make an educated guess about their role in the novel’s key event. It terms of style, it has its moments, not least the following keen observation about the British urban landscape:“a 1960s new town, spreading like a tumour over the heart of Buckinghamshire. No better or worse then a dozen other towns like it, a centre filled with cafes and mobile-phone shops and branches of JD Sports, surrounded by a band of suburbia and beyond the realm of the multiplex cinema and out-of-town Tesco”;Book
It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time.;Book
I enjoyed this book - it kept me interested, but all-in-all, it was just okay. It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl, which I liked better than this one. I felt it dragged on a bit (she's a drunk, we get it), but it was still suspenseful. I did guess (correctly) who the killer was mid-book, so the ending wasn't very exciting...it was just a confirmation of what I already knew. Would I recommend it anyway? Probably.;Book
A slog of a read.  I stuck with it to the very end, but it's only really gripping in the last 2% (I read on Kindle).  The timeline can be ignored--it adds nothing but confusion and helps the reader not in the least.  The writing is pedestrian.  The characters not sharply delineated, they tend to blend into each other.  And enough with the booze motive.  It got it right away, and the author just belabors the same stuff over and over.  Probably better off if you pay the money for the movie.  The cost would be similar, it will take less of your time, plus you can have popcorn.  Not recommended.;Book
"This book had me guessing one thing was happening, when it was quite another.  It was a very decent read, but I can't help feel it could have been so much more with the premise and start of the story being as thought out as it was.  The story revolves around a divorcee who binge drinks and her inability to be a 'reliable' witness in a missing persons case. This could have gone many ways, but ended up with all the males in the story being  users of the women they were with in many different incarnations. This was more the crux of the story; rather than being a mystery (which it still was) it was also a statement on the abusive side of relationships. I would go 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do halves.  It's better than average and and entertaining to read, but still have that gnaw in my gut that it could have been plotted into something much more.  I think the author has a good start to her career here though.";Book
"I am at a loss why everyone is raving about this book and find it ""hard to put down.""  Rachel is exhausting - at first you feel sorry for her and empathize with her, but after about 100 pages of her grasping at her formal life while she is constantly drunk - it gets old really quick.  Anna is a the girl we all hate - loving playing the mistress and enjoying every second of knowing she is stealing a married man.  Megan is just a clingy train wreck, and the men are all portrayed to be scary/sleezy.  Like Gone Girl, there really isn't one character that you can actually like let alone root for.  Halfway through the book I guessed the ending...there is only a handful of characters, so it's not hard to figure out where this is going. Zero twists, worst boring ""suspense"" (I use the term loosely) book....can't believe they are making this into a movie!";Book
This book kept plodding towards the inevitable. I knew who the killer was early in the book. Yet I kept reading in fascination, thinking that surely it couldn't be THAT obvious. Well, it was obvious. I found the main character, Rachel, to be really pathetic and, quite frankly, kind of weird. I did not have any sympathy for her at all. Please, don't waste your time reading this book. I don't know why it got so many great reviews.;Book
"I had to drag myself through this book from beginning to end, and I only finished it because my Book Group is reading it. I thought the writing was shallow and the characters, all of them, were vague and difficult to relate to. I was particularly impatient with the main character, Rachel, in that I thought the author was using her repeated alcoholic episodes as a crutch to extricate herself from having to fully write the exposition. I notice that this book has been compared repeatedly to another terrible book, ""Gone Girl"", and I think that is accurate. If you were impatient with the bad writing, plot and character development in ""Gone Girl"", you will find the exact same weaknesses in ""Girl on the Train"". Inexplicable plot development, unclear and superficial characters, a boring, boring story, and an unsatisfying ending. Don't waste your time.";Book
"I could not believe that Ms. Hawkins could write a book where the ""Girl on the Train"" was such a sad character who happens to be addicted to the awful disease of alcoholism.  It is a shame that this disease's consequences were used to create a most predictable story.  How anyone can say that this is the next ""Gone Girl"" is delusional.  Shame on the author.";Book
"I so wanted to like this book! The beginning was slow but I had nothing else to read so I continued. Then I starting hating the main character because she hated herself; her decision making was beyond poor and her drinking was beyond boring.  In fact all the characters were exaggerated caricatures of ""flawed"" people.  But it was the ending that killed this book. Without providing any spoilers, I absolutely could not believe the ending of the book!  It read like a tired Law and Order: SUV episode (I actually said out loud: are you KIDDING me?).  Before killing off the witnesses, the killer sits there and confesses while everyone drinks tea. Then the protagonist plans his/her suspenseful escape (read the book to see if the escape was successful).  Completely predictable plot line with a boringly predictable ending. Totally unrealistic.  The premise was interesting and might have been better developed by a different author.  This is my honest opinion on how I felt about the book, and what I would have wanted to know before I read it.";Book
The first chapters of this book got me hooked, but it soon became tedious to be inside the mind of a self pitying alcoholic for so long.  Every character in the story was despicable, which does not bode well when one has to spend so much time inside their heads . When the mystery was finally revealed - after too much drinking, whining, and sniveling by nearly everyone, but especially the main protagonist - I was angry that I'd wasted both my time and my money.;Book
The book is written in the same switchback method as 'Gone Girl' and for a while it's an engrossing thriller.  However, the train slows down in the last  30 pages or so, and the killer and ending is not the shocker one would expect from this highly praised story.  More character development would have helped but very little background is provided for each, and what there is exists mostly in conversations.  A good book, but not really deserving of all the hype.;Book
"I have the biggest problem with what passes for psychological thrillers these days.  This and ""Gone Girl"".  I got nothin'.  As in ""Gone Girl"", not one of these characters is (a) likable, (b) believable, or (c) all that interesting.  So why keep reading?  Our protagonist, Rachel, is anything but.  She's so irritating that you want to reach through the pages and slap her around.  Truly, she has so few redeeming qualities that I was not rooting for her in any way, shape or form.  Kind of wishing she was the one that got offed.  Any time there was a stupid thing that could be done, she managed to find something even more stupid and then do THAT thing.  Then she'd get drunk, black out and feel even worse.  I should have put the book down when she vomited on her roommate's rug and then pitched into a drunken blackout and left it there. (Oh, was that a spoiler?  Sorry, my bad.)  And then, you know, there's that thing that happens where after the first four chapters or so, the story is laid out and then nothing much happens -- it's just filler -- until the last chapter when everything resolves.  So there are about 100 or so wasted pages.  Not great.  I'm sure they're doing casting calls for the movie as I write this.";Book
The whole premise of this book was so insipid, like the writer was noodling around for a cute idea to write about as she sat on the train to work. And she started writing and wasn't at all sure where to go with it so she tried making the characters intriguing, but they weren't. Many of the voices were so similar you couldn't tell who was speaking except by looking at the very pale gray label at the top of the page. The people she portrayed were really pathetic, totally lacking a raison d'etre in life. I finished the book because I had nothing else to read at the moment.;Book
"This is a horribly boring ""thriller"". To me there are three key elements to every mystery/ thriller - plot, character, writing. This book is sadly lacking on all accounts. The plot is ok but I figured things out about half way through and I kept plodding toward the conclussion (counting the pages to the enevitable end). The characters were sad, one dimensionioal set pieces that never come to life. The shifting narative was gimmicky at best and a lazy writing style at worst (meaning all we can expect of Ms. Hawkins is more of the same). I have no idea how this became a Number 1 best seller on the NYT list (I guess because of suckers like me). By far the worst book I have read this year (15).";Book
"I have to be honest even with all the amazing reviews I still think I barely liked it.  I bought it because of the zillion good reviews and I am sure that is why most are buying it.SPOILER:I am ok at predicting plot twists but I feel like this one was very very obvious. I mean from the second they tell you Megan babysat and he smiled at her and then a few pages later ""he"" smiled at her driving by it was very obvious that it was Tom...I mean you can't help but compare it to Gone Girl and although I did not like the ending of Gone Girl , Gone Girl blows this book out of the water. Flynn's book is so smart and clever this is kind of boring and mostly about an alcoholic who you don't feel for and I could not even get myself to like a single character or be interested in any of them.I did not care for it at all to each his/her own.";Book
"All I can say after forcing myself to finish this ""novel""  is that the book should have been called the drunk girl on the train. With its predictable plot, undeveloped and unlikeable characters, ""The Girl on a Train"" reads like something one would pick up at an airport newsstand to kill some time. I was numb with disbelief when the ""mystery"" was revealed at the end. I couldn't believe the author would pull the most obvious literary trick out of the hat to reveal the murderer. The lead character is in a drunken fugue for most of the book but clarity returns right at the end along with a smug confession by the killer.The key players were a circle of six which included a pathetic drunk, a mistress-turned wife, an adulteress, a serial liar/cheater, a paranoid husband, and a shady therapist...with some random red-haired man thrown in the mix. No wonder it garnered so many ""five-star reviews,"" and being adapted into a movie...it's suspense-lite that appeals to the masses and will have many flocking to the cinema to see this easy-to-solve-mystery. Most notably, many of the five star reviews are from professional bloggers and vine reviewers who receive free ARC's. I suppose that one too many a critical review would stop those freebies from coming.I am so irritated that I bought this book in hard back, but I guess this is my comeuppance for buying into the summer book reading hype. Hitchcockian this is not, not even close.";Book
The concept of the story is good, but the book rambles on and on with a predictable two page conclusion.  Don't waste your money on this one.;Book
I was not fond of this book because the characters were all such awful people. One after another, they were so messed up.  The book was redundant, yeah, we know Rachel is a boring drunk, we know Megan is a loser.  Both men are horrible!  I can't believe I finished the book. No surprises, since we already knew Megan was having an affair.  Duh.I know we all have our flaws, but I truly have never met anyone like these people.  Maybe I'm just lucky, or don't live in the bottom of a barrel.;Book
"I have about 75 more pages until I'm finished with this book. Yes, it's been dragging along for me and there are a few reasons:  1. The main characters lack real depth. I want to empathize or ""side"" with at least one of the characters but being unformed, they come across as one-dimensional and simply self-absorbed; 2. The book lacks suspense. The pace of the book is erratic because the author jumps back and forth in time for all of the main characters. These ""interruptions"" stall any suspense that should be building and growing and; 3. Like a STEREOTYPICAL day in London, the tone of the of the book is grey and gloomy which equated to dull for me.  I really wanted to like this book like the majority of reviewers and be able to tell friends and relatives, "" You really need to read this book!""  Not the case here.......but that's just my opinion.";Book
I was so disappointed in this book.  Hours of listening to an audio book that was full of codependent, bad decision making, weak women.  I kept hoping something would get better and that there would actually be at least one character that I liked and it never happened.  I must stop falling for books just because they are on a best-seller list.  Bad choice on my part and a lesson learned to read customer reviews before I buy.;Book
Sorely disappointed and difficult to follow especially on a device - had a hard time figuring out who was who and who belonged to who - finally had to write down a flow chart so I didn't have to flip around in my Kindle. And Rachel - honestly, she was ridiculous ---are there people really and truly that stupid? I know there are people who are stuck and cannot make a good decisions for various reasons, but Rachel takes the cake. Not worth reading. Sorry I wasted time on this book.;Book
Not one sympathetic character in the book.  Five main characters and not one of them has any redeeming values.  If this is the world Hawkins lives in, she has my utmost sympathy.  It is one of the worst books I have read in a long time and I read a LOT of books. If you want mystery/thrillers stick with Sandford, Child, Connelly, Silva, Flynn, Baldacci, Coben, DeMille, Thor, etc.  Do not spend your time or money on this book.  You'll regret it.;Book
I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting...;Book
I gave it one star because the author wrote it but I did not like any of the book. I do not like to read about alcoholics, did not find any saving grace in the life of a woman who let the end of her marriage push her to the limits.  Where was her self respect?  There is a sinister allegorical theme woven throughout the story. Unless you want to read misery, skip this one.  Okie Reading Specialist;Book
"I absolutely agree with all the other one-star reviewers.  This book was a big disappointment.  It's a blow-by-blow description of the protagonist's days, which early on gets boring.  The characters, especially the women, are self-involved losers who refuse to improve their lives.  In fact, all the characters in the book are stereotypes; none is interesting.  I hurried through to the end of the book just to get it over with, and I too wish I had my time back.  So much for a New York Times best-seller -- that praise means nothing.";Book
"Though the book has dominated the NYT bestseller list for months, I was not impressed.  From an English mystery, I expected more color, an eccentric sleuth with more expertise, a distinctive setting, a little charm, perhaps a dash of humor;  instead, Train offers an alcoholic slouch with a dreary commute to nowhere.  The biggest mystery in the book is the heroine's blackouts.  The murder is so banal, without passion and inept that it is literally a crime committed without a trace of motive or evidence.  The heroine, generally in a drunken stupor, has some encounters of interest but mostly stumbles around totally clueless and solves the mystery completely by accident.  The accidental solution to the clueless mystery, finally gives readers a taste of redemption and a glimpse of evil.  This is not a case of leaving the best for last; those ingredients could have spiced up the tale and made the ride less tedious.";Book
Careful reading at first will help the reader get the five main characters in focus, and some patience is needed with Rachel.  However,  one is so rewarded by the exciting plot as it unfolds, taking the reader through twist after psychological twist.  I enjoyed the luxury of POV renderings of each character, and the clever way the author left clues for me to think about as the end rushed toward me like a Runaway Train trying to reach its station before the good are not saved and the bad are not caught..  The author makes you care so much for each character, regardless of their weaknesses. Will their strengths of character emerge to bring this complicated human puzzle to a satisfying end? Or will the reader be left asking more questions and be enticed to want more about the future of these characters and those their lives touched?  What an intriguing ride!;Book
Ugh, the best part of this book is that it eventually ends and you feel better.  To me, the mystery notwithstanding, the hardest thing about this book was how incredibly hard it was to like ANY of the characters.  I find it very hard to read a book when I'm not able to really root for anyone.  But, I thought it was a decent enough mystery.  Didn't figure it out way in advance of the end but the possible murderers that the reader is supposed to suspect come across as so deliberately red herrings.  So it becomes a game of who's left after you eliminate the other possible suspects.  If this were not a book group selection I probably wouldn't have finished.  However, it gets two stars instead of one from me because at the end, I did develop some empathy for our drunken heroine.  So, there was that.;Book
I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away.;Book
"Well, it is definitely a summer chick book.  The protagonist, big surprise, is a female, whose life is falling apart.  In the spirit of Rear Window (only Jimmie Stewart does it justice) she sees something that's not right and immediately she makes a gazillion unfounded assumptions (like Rear Window and that other flick with Shia Labeouf).  It gets interesting, finally 2/3 into the book, but you can tell that the target audience of this book was not male.  Woman will love the personal relationships sprinkled with the protagonists imagination, and they may even identify with the other female characters in the book, but overall, it was like watching a trainwreck:  I couldn't NOT finish it, but I;'m not sure I wanted to.  Ladies, you'll love it.  Guys, try Secretary Gates' book or An Army at Dawn this summer...";Book
Two things led me to pick this book to read. First one is the fact that this book belonged to psychological thriller genre and second is it being the top seller on Amazon for consistent weeks. However, after completing the book, I should say it was an above average read (falls short when compared to Gone Girl). The story as it progresses is quite intriguing and keeps the reader hooked, but as it nears the end, the story becomes a tad predictable. The story is centered around Rachel, the protagonist who is made to believe that she doesn't remember anything after black out, but one day she ends up being a witness to a murder when she is totally drunk. How she decides and interprets the events of that day forms the crux of the story. I definitely liked the way, the story is presented with careful juggling of the events from the past year and the present date. To summarize, I would say it is a good read.;Book
This was an enjoyable book with plenty of twists and turns to keep me turning the pages. While there were parts of the book that were predictable, Hawkins does a nice job of keeping the reader guessing about the outcome. While at times I wanted to know more about certain characters in the book, they were developed well enough that i found myself connecting with them emotionally from start to finish. The story is told from the viewpoints of the three main female characters (Rachel, Megan and Anna), which adds to the mystery and emotion of the story. The pace of this book is enjoyable - while I was eager to get to the end of the story, at the same time, there were moments when taking a rest from the sadness that often defined Rachel's life became necessary for me emotionally. It was a good book, and a relatively quick read.;Book
This was so badly written I gave up at 50%. Writing from three different women's perspectives yet they all sound just the same? Unbelievable sightings from the train, shallow character development. Why is this so popular??;Book
It was a downer for the most part .  Rachels alcohol issues were way overstated, and none of the characters wereParticularly likeable.  They all seemed needy, spoiled, neurotic, or vacant.  What I disliked most was that she waspretty vague at the beginning when you were trying to figure things out, and then she discloses pertinent information toward the end. For a mystery writer, it's sort of a cheating tactic. Better to have good clues throughout the book that continue to unfold to build the mystery evenly.  It was very spotty and uneven,and none of the characters had much depth or character!;Book
Very enjoyable!  Hard to put down.  The author, characters and plot make you want to keep going right until the end.  I tend to get so caught up in the action that I read less for comprehension than to FINISH!  As much as I enjoy switching between the characters voices, the change in the time was more than I could manage easily.  But the book was written well enough so that even if you weren't paying attention to the dates, you could almost always figure out when you were based on the events.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it's been so built up in the media, by the time I read it, it was less than I expected.;Book
Easy reading;Book
"The story was compelling from the beginning, even though it took awhile to get into it and figure out how it was written. Each chapter is told from a different character's viewpoint, so we learn the 'truth' about things and then another's perception of the same things. The main character has lost her job, but rides the train every day into town so her roommate won't know she is unemployed. Suffering from low self-esteem, she drinks more than she should and subsequently suffers from the occasional blackout. She passes by the same houses every day, and has made up stories about a particular couple, imagining their perfect life. When the female part of the couple goes missing, the main character inserts herself into the investigation, sure she has information that is valuable. As the mystery deepens, she then wonders if she was somehow involved, as she had a 'blackout' episode at the time of the disappearance. For me, the plot took a strange, unlikely turn, and the lead character was not a very sympathetic character. The format reminded me of ""Gone Girl"", which was a much better story.";Book
"I really wanted to love this book and had high hopes based on other reader comments.  I greatly enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" but this book pales in comparison.  The 3 female characters with alternating POVs are all pathetic. Their middle class problems seem so first world and were not compelling.  One of the females, Megan, and one of the 2 main male characters, Tom, are conveniently compulsive liars and cheats and no one ever meets the parents or family of either (Megan's family conveniently dead, Tom's estranged) -- it felt so contrived! Then to add the final insult SPOILER ALTER -- pathetic Rachel (who is a white, educated, middle class adult, presumably in her 30's) ends up having everything worked out when her mother coughs up some money for her to get back on her feet and get a fresh start. Rachel didn't do anything real to rebuild her life or improve herself. Saved by mummy's money. Ugh!";Book
"Ahh, the hot best seller of the season... A good read, a solid story with solid writing and a cautionary (don't be a boozer) nugget to boot. The seemingly good characters turn out to be much worse people than expected--and visa versa. We observe a semi-likable protagonist swimming upstream against a current of alcoholism, trying to clear her head and remember what happened the night she came home bloodied and a woman from a nearby neighborhood vanished. The ""surprise ending"" seemed over the top, a bit of story-telling hyperbole that didn't really fit with the tone and weight of the preceding tale. A decent book that proves once again the fallacy of looking for greatness or literature among the best sellers.";Book
"I probably would have enjoyed this more were it not for the countless ""NEXT GONE GIRL"" and ""HITCHCOCKIAN"" promises thrown around in countless reviews. I kept waiting for a twist that never came, and I was disappointed. An ok book, but nothing special ...and certainly no Gone Girl.";Book
"The Girl on the Train, I'll admit I was sucked in from the beginning. I grabbed a bag of chips, ordered pizza, and prepared for an intriguing night in. Just me and my book. The back-and-forth, 3-narrator structure was a bit confusing at first, but I could forgive it because it added a touch more suspense and depth to the story. However, after I finished the last page (and last pizza slice) I found myself a bit hollow. The story had somehow gone from an interesting premise to an ending so formulaic, so obvious, it was, well, ludicrous. I figured out the culprit about halfway through, but I was sure I had to be wrong, that the author just wanted me to think that I knew. And I waited for the twist that never came. As I read the last few paragraphs of the climax I couldn't believe how ordinary an ending this book was turning out to have. Ms. Hawkins succeeded in churning out a uniquely premised mystery only to muddy it with a Lifetime movie ending. ""Our heroine is beat till she's bloody and battered, and just when you think she's defeated...she shocks us all with her heroic sleight of hand""....spare me. Too many coincidences made the story unbelievable and worthy of more than a few eye rolls. I gave three stars because I like her writing style and it held my interest, but the ending fell flat--like Drunk Rachel.";Book
"This sounded so good, and the first few dozen pages were good — the three narrators do a decent job of pulling you into what begins as parallel romantic dramas, with the bulk of it all being narrated by Rachel, the ex of one of the two men (who live a couple doors away from one another). Rachel has a drinking problem, as you will soon experience in repetitive, unending, mind-numbing detail. And she has a blackout on the night in question which haunts her, because it's during that blackout that Something Happens (that's not a spoiler, it's the whole premise of the book.) Like I said, the set-up is ok, and the stories are involving, but about halfway through you realize that you're only halfway through. What, is there an index at the end that takes up a third of the book? No. I suppose to make the story plod along more ""realistically,"" the author pads the tale with a mountain of repetition (oh did I say that already? Maybe it's contagious!)  — thoughts, conversations, situations, over and over and over. It's funny — the other characters get very tired of Rachel's drama, and you can't help but sympathize. She's just as boring as drunks generally are — so I suppose the author should get credit for accurately portraying a bore. Towards the end, I wasn't even reading it anymore, I was just glancing at paragraphs to get the gist. And after all that work, the big reveal feels more like a big letdown. Skip it — you can't get those 20 hours of your life back. I say go read ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" instead.";Book
"I can't believe all these four and five star reviews!  I had to plow through this book because I found it not only boring but distasteful, like Gone Girl.  All about sleazy people whose main occupation was having sex with each other.  The means of telling the story--first-person snippets by the three female characters--struck me as sloppy writing, an easy ""out"" that let the author not bother with the finer details of plot. And the people were not interesting!  Their lives, including those of the men, were incredibly shallow..  I am an older reader but I don't object to sex in stories, just to sloppy writing about people that are so dull and uninspiring.  But this seems to be the new trend in best-selling books which speaks to me of how readers' tastes have deteriorated.";Book
Almost aborted in 1st chapter.  After several, I skipped to last chapter.  That's all I needed. Rest was a laborious bore.;Book
"It was not the worst thing I've read. But it was very, very far from the best. The author's writing is technically fine. And she does do a good job of depicting the characters and scenes. Well, that is she does if her intention was for the reader to not just dislike the characters, but to utterly abhor them. I realize that to some extent we are not supposed to like them. But usually with a cast of unlikable characters there is some redeeming value somewhere. This book had none! I didn't like the characters, but more importantly couldn't have cared less about what happened to them. I struggled to finish this book. Mostly I kept thinking I was missing something - it has gotten such great reviews that I felt like maybe just around the next page there would be something to like. Alas, there never was. A previous review stated it well - the characters are ""not merely unlikable; their un-likability is forced and exaggerated. Rachel's convenient blackouts happen so frequently as to become tedious"". Everything about this book was tedious. I can't imagine the soon-to-be-released movie will be any better!";Book
I didn't start reading this book until I saw the movie trailer released. I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm certain this is one of the most suspenseful and dynamic books I have read in quite some time. The characters were relatable and complex, human and ordinary, like the person sitting next to you on a commuter train. I lost myself and the passing of time as I continued reading. I felt bad and hated each character so thoroughly I didn't want to come to the end. Great read and can't wait to be disappointed by what Hollywood leaves out in the theater.;Book
My sister had raved about this book so I made it a point to buy it when a discounted price became available.  Hawkins writes well and her story is quite good but I have never met a bunch of less likeable characters.  Perhaps, as a very literal person, I missed her point if Hawkins intended to portray everyone so negatively, but I like at least one person to root for in a book.  The central character was incredibly weak and seemingly proud of her inablity to pull herself out of her neediness and addicton.  The other characters were angry, selfish, violent, and/or not terribly bright.I will credit Hawkins with keeping the ending fairly opaque until near the end but this is not a book I particularly enjoyed.  Plus now I have to fib to my sister.;Book
"I had started to read Gone Girl, but, didn't finish it because I thought the characters were pathetic people. Which, by the way, takes very good writing. But, it didn't work for me. Partway through The Girl On The Train, I thought I had another Gone Girl on my hands. No way!! I could not stop reading this book. At first I thought Rachel was just a sad, pathetic person, but, as I read more I saw the depth to her character. There are plot twists and surprises I never saw coming. I was impressed with the book. I never read books that someone ""recommends"", whether that person is a friend, celebrity, or book critic. But, my daughter told me that she heard this was good, so, I gave it a try. By the way, my daughter has the audible version and it quite impressed with the work of the voice actors and the story itself. I totally loved this book. I would read something else by this author.";Book
I did not really like this I do not see what all the hype is gone girl was better;Book
I really enjoyed reading this book, I can say that probably is one of the best books I've read so far, I don't want to write any spoilers, so just keeping it simple, I will say that it had a great pace, well built  characters, the story will definitely keep you hooked the entire time, and you just need to get to the bottom of everything. I gave it the highest rating, because lets face it, the book was so freakishly awesome. I wouldn't change anything, it's a masterpiece. I totally recommend it to any avid reader who enjoys a thriller book, with some romance, suspense, and complicated situations. Thanks to the author, I look forward to read some more of her work.;Book
I didn't like this at first, and I thought the author had some trouble distinguishing the voice of some of the characters, but got better as it went along. Well worth the read in the end.;Book
"I don't like to criticize any author who spends hundreds of hours writing something for readers to enjoy.Clearly, Paula Hawkins' perseverance has paid off for her since she's been on the best seller lists for many months, so who am I to go against public opinion--and the NY Times critic?At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to complain a bit.Using an ""unreliable narrator"" device can be tricky. There ARE authors who handle it  really well---( A Pleasure and A Calling by Phil Hogan does this beautifully, for example. ) For me, after reaching the end of Girl on a Train, rather than being delighted at being fooled, I was annoyed.  The narrator's ""inner thoughts,"" aren't really honest ones --she holds information back from whom?  Herself? Plus  the plot has so many holes in it that even the most bumbling detective would have figured out just what went on.";Book
The story was good, you felt for the main character and how she was dealing with her life problems.  I had a hard time staying engrossed because the author chose to not only switch between different characters' voices by chapter, but she also skipped around in time sequence.  The ending was something of a surprise.  I wouldn't rush to buy another of her books, though.;Book
"This book was an easy read but I am not sure why it got such outstanding reviews.  Although the book was suspenseful I did find it predictable.  Too bad, I am not sure I can agree either that it was Hitchcockian.  But for those who enjoyed it, good for them.  I on the other hand don't understand they hype....Though some of the relationships were believable, others were far fetched and contrived.  Too much emphasis was put on the ""blackouts"".  Their purpose of them seemed to me to be giving the author creative license because heck she was too drunk to remember. It was a good premise but a disappointing delivery. This is my opinion, I don't like giving to many details when reviewing a book, in the event someone would like to read it anyway.  I did not hate the book so I did give it a 3 for the suspense, but with so many positive reviews this book fell short.";Book
"I found this highly touted book to be quite boring and frankly tedious.  The main character is wading through a quagmire of depression, delusion and gin and tonics in a can.  Most of the book takes place on a commuter train; the heroine is in an inebriated haze throughout.  As a psychologist I appreciate the difficulties of depression but this book does not handle the subject well.  All of the characters are hard to empathize with so one is left with ""no horse in the race"" to root for.  There are a couple of mild surprises but I seriously would not recommend this book to any of my friends.";Book
"I must admit that it took me two different attempts to finish this book.  The first time I started it I just couldn't really get into it...maybe because I do not like books written in the ""first person"" and I found the separate individual chapters disconcerting.  Since knowing that the highly anticipated movie was coming out shortly and the incredible number of weeks it's been on the NYT's best seller list I decided to start the book again. I did  finish it, I am glad I did, but I didn't like the writers style and thought that it certainly did not live up to it's hype.";Book
"Read the book because I wanted to compare it versus the movie which opens in theaters today.The story is told by 3 different women. Rachel, the jobless alcoholic; Anna, the woman who married Rachel's ex-husband; and Megan, a woman that lives four doors away from Anna and Tom (Rachel's ex-husband). Each one has issues in the past and each one is ""flawed"" in their own way.I really enjoy a good plot twist and this book does not disappoint. It's been a long time since I stopped what I was doing to finish a book because I HAD to find out how it ended!";Book
"I read this after it was recommended by a friend. I thought it was fast paced & interesting. I'm not a big fan of ""amnesia"" murder stories because it's all too convenient. It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue. It did manage to hold my interest and I didn't want to stop reading. It was suspenseful and entertaining.";Book
If the story moved a little faster I would have given it a better score.  The story focuses around an alcoholic with little communication with others until about the middle of the book.  She knows she is an alcoholic with no life but does nothing to make her life better.  She basically sabotages anything positive in her life.  The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.  I will admit to skipping some pages as they dragged on going nowhere.;Book
"I can't believe how popular this book is! None of the main characters are likeable or nuanced. The female characters all share the same character flaw which guides their poor choices. Bunch of doormats willing to put up with significant weaknesses in their interpersonal relationships who keep repeating the same self destructive behaviors.  The male characters are self-centered and misogynistic.  Yuck.  The storyline is billed as mystery, but it's not a very iintriguing plot. The ending is not realistic and not satisfying, I guess in large part because by then I disliked the main protagonist so much I just didn't care about her ""happy ending.""";Book
I also hated this book. It is so boringly repetitive, the plot moves at a glacial pace, but my main complaints are about the writing. If the author chooses to use three narrative voices, there should be at least SOME differences in how they sound. Not here - if you missed the name of the narrator at the beginning of each chapter you are out of luck since not only the voices, but even the content of their tales is pathetically similar. What a waste of time and money! How could this book be on a bestseller list for so long is beyond me. And, by the way, I thought Gone Girl was fine.;Book
When this book was compared to Gone Girl and a Hitchcock like ending I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. The vacuous characters and confusing back and forth time lines made my head spin.  Never could get a grip on what the point was.  Why the hype?;Book
No spoilers here.I thought the story was decently written and accurately portrayed the issues the characters were facing in the story. However, more character development could have been done, and I think that the shifting narration sometimes detracted from the story. For me, it was not too much of a thriller or very suspenseful. I think some plot points that were supposed to be twists or surprises were spoiled with heavy-handed foreshadowing.In short, it wasn't a bad read, but it was far from the best suspense/thriller novel that I've read.;Book
This is a book review, not a summary, so I won't simply regurgitate the story here.I hadn't heard the comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl before I read this novel but I can see some resemblance: both have female leads and both have great plot twists. Other than that, they're completely different. I liked the perspective of seeing things from inside a train and how that narrow focus gradually widened until we could see the whole picture. There were a few obvious red herrings but the suspense was maintained throughout. Also, I think the author nailed the behavior of an alcoholic as well as how such behavior has a ripple effect on everyone else. However, the overall character development -- so important for a good story -- was a little thin (I never got a solid mental picture of anyone), but the pacing was fantastic and the plot twists were well done so that's why I gave it four stars.;Book
If it ever happens again that I consider a Paula Hawkins book, I pray someone shakes me until I come to my senses.Muddled and exhausting. The ramblings of an alcoholic, schizophrenic, nymphomanic?  The story got too sickening to figure it out.  It is hard to believe that so many people bought this book.I believe the comments by A. Grace hit the tack on the cranium. Wish I had read that before I ordered the book.;Book
While I enjoy a good murder mystery, I also like to have some compassion for at least one character. The writing was good, hence the two stars but I didn't care about any of the characters especially the main one. The only thing I cared about at the end was the money I spent buying this book. Not one character was remotely likable. I wouldn't purchase another book by this author.;Book
Holds attention and keeps you guessing so you HAVE to know what comes next!;Book
Although I understand the process of jumping around on time frames in this book it seemed a little more bewildering than some others I have read. In fact for the first hundred pages I really had a hard time getting into the story because Rachel was so pathetic that she was hard to even root for. This does not mean she was not a well-developed character nor does it mean the book was poorly written. I simply had a hard time identifying with any of the characters and it may be because the author was attempting to use Rachel's black periods as a device to make you question what really happened. About two-thirds of the way through the book I had determined who I believed killed Megan so the only thing left to do was to see who lived who died and who went to jail. The finale of the book was well done and feel true to form. I appreciate the story and I always enjoy a mystery but this book did not grab me as much as some others I have read recently. I still think many people would really enjoy reading the book and of course it would make a wonderful movie as has already been done. I simply believe that there are other books that do suspense better than this one although this is a fun read and I cannot say I was disappointed by it. Some of it just felt like it had been done before and in some cases better. As you can see I still believe it was a 4 out of 5 and therefore worth the time to read. Pardon the grammar, it is difficult to write a review on your cell phone.;Book
A few people highly recommended this book so I gave it a try. Found the beginning to be very slow and almost stopped reading it. The story eventually got interesting but I never really cared for the main character. Maybe the story will be turned into an interesting movie but I cannot recommend reading the book.;Book
I heard a lot about this book so I thought I'd check it out. It was better than I thought it would be. I did figure out who the killer is pretty much before the end, but I was watching pretty carefully for the clues. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I don't expect it to be as good as the book.;Book
I bought this book to see what all the fuss was about.  Now I know.  This is a great book!  Giving you just enough information when you need it as you go along is a great way to keep the reader from becoming bored.  Different view points from different characters.  Very well written.  Twisted story.;Book
I wanted to like this book, and while it was suspenseful, the plot was highly unrealistic.  While I was reading, I kept telling myself there was no way that something like this would happen in real life.  None of the characters are likeable, which is fine, but the major character shifts in two key characters feel contrived and unconvincing.  The shifting connections between all the main characters are not believable either.  The book's strongest element is its setting, reinforced by Rachel's constant train rides.  I'm not why this book came so highly hyped.  It was OK, but I wouldn't read it again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to a friend.;Book
I have NO IDEA why this is #1 on the best seller list. It is OK not great. Read this book if you are on vacation or taking a flight and want a book that won't make you think. It's an easy read. None of the characters make you want to care about them or solve the case.;Book
This book is full of self-doubt, alcoholism and sadness.  I did NOT enjoy this book - kept reading it so that it may materialize into something happier - it really never did.  I'm sorry I wasted my time.  I was so depressed after reading it.  I mentioned I read it on Facebook and everyone commented how sad it was.  Guess that's what the author had in mind ... so, well ... she achieved that.;Book
It was well written, but excruciatingly boring. The only excitement I felt was when I was finished. I can't imagine why they would make this book into a movie, that would be a total bore.Besides the very end of the book this wasn't very interesting. None of the characters were likable, in fact I hated them all. Not one favorite. Waste of my time.;Book
I bought this out of curiosity since it is such a huge bestseller. It is just okay, I fail to see anything special in it. I'm not a huge fan of unreliable narrators for one thing. It makes you wonder if you're just wasting time reading stuff that turns out to be untrue. The protagonist, a slobbering drunk with no respect for others' privacy, is thoroughly unlikable until the ending. The London setting would be intriguing if we got to see more of it, it's mostly train tracks and views from a train window. The supporting cast of characters is thinly drawn. We spend way too much time reading about the protag's drunken stupors, and not enough getting to know anyone else. One has to wonder whether all the glittering blurb-it's actually read it, or were just jumping on the underserved hype train.;Book
"This book was worse than a waste of time. Decided to keep reading this inane story due to my own stubborn tendency not to quit books in the middle. My own fault. The protagonist, Rachel, is a complete wing-nut who happens to also be an alcoholic and consciously makes the wrong decision at every opportunity with or without the aid of alcohol. She is impossible to like and her monotonous internal chatter takes up a lot of the story. Sigh. The book is fraught with maddening ""unrealities"", for instance, Rachel survives financially for days and days on a ""tenner"" that her cliche' enabler flatmate, Cathy, loaned her. Really? The enormous plot twist near the end is the kicker that has me writing this review. It was simply ridiculous. I'm left wondering how this book was ever published in the first place, and who are these people giving 4 & 5 star reviews?";Book
For some reason, I was expecting a Gone Girl-style twist in this novel but it was more of a slow build to an increasingly obvious conclusion. It was also kind of like the Lifetime movie of novels - there may be an entertaining storyline, but there's nothing brilliant about it, no real themes or moral to the story, no character development of any significance or depth... It just kind of describes a series of events and tries to thrill the reader a bit. Over all, it was worth reading because it held my attention for a week, but I won't likely sing its praises to anyone or recommend it.;Book
"The story was reasonably interesting at first, but the first person narrative for all three women was sometimes tough to distinguish.  Their voices were too similar.  The author also kind of lost me with Anna; she was just so cold and surprisingly shallow compared to the other two. If she's meant to be that way, that's fine, but really she was unbelievable at times.  The big finish/twist was also wrapped too neatly and too quickly.Overall a mediocre, quick read for a lazy day but it will not be totally satisfying. I wish I had spent my money elsewhere.";Book
Read this novel and really wanted to love it but I couldn't. It's full of very flawed characters (as is life I suppose) and it's very hard to root for anyone, especially the protagonist. I find it difficult to read a book and feel satisfied when you aren't rooting for anyone. I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?). I'll be interested to see how the movie unfolds as the book is a narrative from the view point of  3 different women. Can't recommend the book.;Book
Obviously this is a very popular book right now. So it was on my to read list. When I got to the mystery or thriller challenge, I wanted to read this.This is a quick paced, easy to read book.I loved the relationships with Rachel and everyone else.Rachel was flawed and yet I was rooting for her. I wanted her to get it together and have a life and find someone to love her. I wanted her to have a family.Most of the way through the book, I was undecided on who did it. A little more than halfway through, I started thinking it was who it turned out to be. Little clues along the way made me begin to wonder about who it really was.I got a little worried for her safety towards the end.All in all, a fast paced, enjoyable read. A great mystery that will leave you questioning who and what all the way through.;Book
"Great suspenseful book. I couldn't put it down.  I don't usually read fiction books; I'm more of a non-fiction and biography reader.  This book was chosen for a book club that I was a member of, so I figured that I better read it so I could be part of the conversation.  I'm so glad that I did because I had a hard time putting this book down.  When I had to put it down to, I couldn't stop thinking about what was going to happen next.  It was a really well written book with great character development.  I wish the ending was a little different (I kinda saw that coming towards the end of the book).";Book
"This is dark. And it's depressing. And it's really creepy. The characters all have almost unfathomable problems that make your heart break. But once you start reading Paula Hawkins's ""The Girl on the Train,"" all you will want to do is read.This chilling book--combination psychological thriller and who-done-it--tells the story of three women and two men living in the London suburbs and the love, lies and jealousies that break them. Each chapter is told from the first-person point of view of one of the women. The writing is riveting and the plot compelling, and even when you guess ""who done it,"" there are more twists and turns to come.Advice: Take it to the beach or save it for a snow day when you can just give in and read for hours at a time. It's THAT good.";Book
"Finishing this book became a chore for me about half way through.  The ending was dull and I felt that most of the story didn't tie in much.  There are several narratives, all unlikable.  It tries to be a suspense, but I was bored. You could read the first few and last chapters and not be missing much.  I felt like the author was adding fluff to make a short story into a book.  Honestly I feel like it is super overrated and taking a ride on ""Books similar to Gone Girl"" bus.";Book
The Girl on the Train: A NovelI enjoyed this book! It is written from each character's perspective, one at a time. It conveys how we can each live out the same scenario, yet perceive the events completely differently. The plot unfolds to keep you guessing as to the truth of the actual events and whose perspective is accurate, if any. Although it wasn't one I couldn't put down, I did find myself wanting to make time to sit down and read. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. If you found this review to be helpful, would you please take a moment to mark it as such. Thanks!;Book
I bought this book because people said it was comparable to Gone Girl. It is not. The suspense and buildup are fine but the storytelling is mediocre. Some of the characters were given back stories but these weren't all explained in the story. Gone Girl is so much better than this- the storytelling, the suspense, and the character motives.;Book
At first I loathed every character. I felt for Rachel experiencing similar events in my life. She made me mad, she made me examine my own life. I've come to understand Rachel and become her champion! I hated Anna, how dare she do what she did? But then you feel for her as a mother, but have a sour taste in your mouth. Oh Megan! I almost feel like we all have a Megan in our lives. You worry for her, judge her, hate her, love her and want to help her. This book hits close to home for me and probably for many more. I couldn't put it down, even when I wanted too.;Book
This book was selected to be read in my monthly book club. Unlike some book clubs, we actually read the books! I really wanted to like this book but I just found it really difficult to keep the characters straight. I was constantly trying to remind myself who was who and flipping back to previous chapters to make sure I knew which character the author was referring to. This was just not a good book for me. I probably have ADD or ADD tendencies so this book did not help with that at all. I will say that there is a great plot twist at the end - I considered this to be my reward for hanging in there until the end.;Book
"The Girl on the Train was definitely unexpected! The story is told from the points of view of three very different women with one thing in common. None of these three woman are entirely admirable characters. All three have very few redeeming qualities. For the first few chapters it was difficult to feel particularly close to any of them... but it was like driving by a car accident. You know you shouldn't...but you just have to look as you go by.The more I read, the more I had to read on. I subjected anyone who would listen to analyses and theories on who dunnit. Believe me, my accusations evolved rapidly with each turning page... but it wasn't until the last few chapters that the true sinister culprit came forth with clarity and a sense of ""how did I not see this from the start?!""The Girl on the Train was just as, if not more, gripping than Gone Girl.";Book
Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie.;Book
The Girl on the Train is a great read.  It took me about a fourth of the way into the story to get into it but once I did I didn't want to put it down.  I started the book on a flight and the return flight just wasn't long enough.  I wanted to keep flying so I could keep reading.  I ended up staying up too late one night to find out how the book would end.  The characters are interesting.  The mood was rather dark.  I like the story told from the viewpoint of each character which seems to be the new trend in writing these days.  I thought I knew how the book would end but I was wrong.  There are lots of twists and turns in the plot and it will keep you guessing. This is the best book I have read in a long time.  When I finished the book I didn't want it to end.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the next book by Paula Hawkins.;Book
I loved this book, more than I thought I would. Love the multiple narrators with the different perspectives, the swirling revelations that are revealed in an almost rollercoaster fashion. I've missed sleep to read and finish it .that says a lot for me!;Book
"This sounded good & I had high hopes! It's an ok enough book that it keeps you reading until the end, but it's not a favourite. The main character, Rachel, is so pitiful & self-loathing, it's hard to identify with her. Maybe this is what the author was going for, but I don't think it was done very well. The twist at the end was more disappointing than satisfying. I found the timeline was very difficult to keep track of as it kept bouncing around with each new character chapter - I kept forgetting ""when"" it was & had to go back & check. Overall an ok 1st book to read on my new kindle but not one I'd recommend to someone. Happy I only paid for the kindle edition vs the real book & even then, it's overpriced for what it is. Sorry! Just didn't enjoy it.If you want a good thriller book, try Gone Girl or The Silent Wife - both good reads!";Book
"""Girl on the Train"" has been on the NY Times bestseller list for so long that I thought it must be a compelling novel.  Wrong.  The premise of the story sounds interesting, but the telling of the story didn't 'grab' me.  Using alcoholic blackouts as a suspense tool was weak, in my opinion.  The main character, Rachel, is so flawed and the situations she finds herself in are just not believable.  Even lab rats learn to alter their behavior with repeated negative stimulus, but not Rachel.  I just couldn't engage with or care about the other characters either.  I usually pass books along to friends, but this one has been sitting on a table for weeks.  I finally realized I don't want to burden anyone else I know with this story, so I'm donating it to a used bookstore.";Book
"At first I thought, oh no, it's Gone Girl set outside of London. That comparison quickly faded as this book is actually better. The flawed main protagonist helps. Actually all the characters are flawed, rendering them both unreliable and sympathetic. This unreliability, drawn up through actual physical reasons for doubt to reasons of lies, emotional distance, and lack of information on a character serves as a constant feed for the tension and its consistent throughout all the diary-like entries.I generally dislike dates as chapter headings. It's just another thing to keep track of and my mind quickly reads over them (hence I forget them straight away) because I hurry right to the ""juicy stuff."" And this book has lots of juicy bits, but the dates ARE important and I made an effort to keep track.5 stars is not quite enough to give this book, I'd say 7-9 was closer out of an imaginary 10.";Book
I started this book a few months ago and put it away. A friend was reading it so I thought I would give it another try. Do not read this book if you're depressed or sad....the whole premise is sick and twisted.  It does depict the sadness and desperation of alcoholism- the total wasting away of someone life. This is not a summer beach read!  I think the author was channeling Gone Girl- no more depressing books for me.;Book
"I thought this would be similar to the Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" but I was wrong. This was a very black and depressing story. The main character was very unlike able and too much of the story was her imagination of events. I had a hard time getting thru the book and eventually decided not to finish reading it. I would not recommend it.";Book
"The characters are under-developed and all seem to have a very similar voice. The use of changing point-of-view just does not really cut it in this book. Each character is fairly flat and about two thrids through the book, I was able to figure out ""who done it."" Or at least ""who probably done it."" I'm still glad I read it, to see what all the buzz is about, and to experience a serious writer's foray into contemporary fiction. This is not great literature; not a terribly deep story, and certainly not on par with Hitchkock thrillers. The writing is straightforward and this is a quick read; almost a page turner. Ok, I admit I turned the page rather quickly. I'd like to add that I'm rooting for Paula Hawkins as a fiction writer, in spite of my tepid review. She is smart and amazing. We will be seeing more great stuff from her.";Book
Interesting style but used to the point of the story being over-written, over complicated, and self indulgent.;Book
I couldn't put this one down - I stayed up all night reading this book it was completely engrossing. The characters were FULL of surprises, the plot took many turns, and I genuinely cared what happened to the heroine, even though she is extremely complicated. This was well done and the best thriller I've read since Gone Girl. It's hard for an author to have character this complex be so captivating and likeable, but Paula Hawkins pulled it off. It's like when a movie star is able to play a villain that you both loathe and like. It's tough but fascinating, just like this book!;Book
I read this for a book club at work. It's a slow starter, let me just say. The entire set up on the story involves a lot of introspective internal monologue by the main character, drinking on the train and miserable about something, but you don't find out too much for what seemed like the first quarter of the book. It is good at the end and I'm not sorry I read it. The last quarter of story picks up speed, has twists and generally makes up for the slow start.Also, it's not linear. It jumps from the point of view of one female character to the next and then back. It takes a little getting used to, but the characters have a fairly distinct voices, so it gets easier to follow as you go.I chose Dark as the mood for this book, because it is a murder mystery. More along the lines of Gone Girl.;Book
For a debut novel, you would never know this author had not written before. It is absolutely absorbing, I couldn't put it down.It starts with Rachel riding the train past the house she lived in with her ex who now lives there with his new wife. Also a couple of houses down she observes a loving couple and every day she looks up and watches as the train passes.She makes up names for the loving couple and wonders if she could ever have that kind of love again.This story quickly twists and turns. It is not a romance. Rachel ends up far deeper in the lives of the people in both houses than you expect.I found this book to be gripping and could not wait for the result. This book to me, is book shelf worthy, my only regret is that I purchased it on my kindle. I will watch for this author again. If she could come up with this, what else does she have to tell?;Book
"I forced myself to read the whole book.  Rachel was a weak baby, and I wanted to shake her and say, ""grow up"".  Talk about blind to anything around her.  Megan was a weak nympho.  It was a book that left you dissatisfied.";Book
If I had to describe this book in two words, it would be: cheap fiction. The book is mostly written from the perspective of a unreliable, despondent alcoholic mess of a human being. The prose was therefore equally unpolished, lazy, and uninspired. The story itself was somewhat suspenseful -- hence two stars instead of one -- but the resolution unfolds so quickly at the end that it makes you realize that the other 90% of the book was excess junk. Sadly this story could have been told in 30 pages.;Book
"I got confused with the alternating of persons.  I felt like I had to force myself to finish the book.  The end tied everything together with a surprise ending, perhaps the best part of the book.  I bought this book because my daughter wanted to read it because it is on the list of best sellers.  Now that I have finished I told her to be aware that there are 3 different women telling their story and to keep that in mind as you read the book.  Perhaps if I would have been aware of this, I would have rated the book differently.  The women in the story were not ""strong"" women that you would want your daughters to follow as role models.  They each had their issues and in my opinion, set back the way women are viewed and treated.";Book
"This book was very hard to get into as it begins a bit oddly so I put it away to read something else.  Then I saw a trailer for the upcoming movie and I thought that looks good so maybe I will try once more to read the book.  I did go back to it, stuck with it, and once the other characters who narrate the story get involved in telling their side of the story, it all made sense and became a good read to the point that I had to find out who committed the dastardly deed.  I was surprised at the ending.  Stick with it; I think you will be glad you did.";Book
The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins is a psychological thriller.  Rachael Watson is the Girl on the Train and she is the main character.  Through her train trips we meet the other characters ;Book
"Before the end of the book, I had figured out who the killer was, but it had taken me a while.  But even knowing that did not diminish the suspense in this book because I couldn't anticipate how it was going to play out.  I am not going to summarize the plot, but this book was different than anything that I have read, and I read a lot of police procedurals and murder mysteries.  I was intrigued by the blurbs about how the story was about a girl who viewed things from a train; when I am a passenger, I like to look in houses that I am passing and imagine what is happening.  What follows is plausible.  I took me a while to warm up to Rachel, and I can't say that I really liked any of the characters by the end of the novel, but there aren't too many books that I can't wait to get back to.  This was one.";Book
"I like to believe what I read even if it is fiction.  It was hard to believe there could be real people with so much emotional damage as the characters in the novel.  Unfortunately, the nightly news reminds us there are.  The story is like a cork-screw with many twists and turns right up to the final pages which ends like a thrilling movie rather than insightful literature.  However, this seems to be the direction of novels of various genre the last few years which makes me feel some authors are writing with an eye on the big screen.  As a psychological crime novel without an obvious detective and several suspects, it kept me guessing and I rated it as ""good"".  Be careful out there: reality may be stranger than fiction.";Book
"It is both frustrating and enticing to see Rachel's efforts to remember that fateful night. The night she was drunk (again) and a woman disappeared. Rachel meddles with the investigation... sort of... because she liked to watch the woman and her husband from her seat on the London train. Although a couple of houses away live her ex-husband and his new wife and baby, and she kind of stalks them, too. So much sorrow and confusion...I thought the novel was brilliant in depicting an alcoholic's struggle, on top of the ""whodunnit"" story itself. Rachel is both creepy and pitiable. As much of a ""loser hero"" as she was, I found myself rooting for her.My only disappointment came at the end, which was way too drawn-out and gore for my taste. Once we know who's done it, please, wrap it up. Otherwise a really good thriller.";Book
I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly.;Book
I'm giving this book one star because of the ending -- which disappoints on so many levels. My method of reading this was a Kindle, so I'd say the book was an absolute fantastic page-turner until about 85%. Then I started getting a picture of how the book would end. I'll deliver no spoilers. Let's just say, by book's end I thought all of the three women principal characters were pretty much idiots. And all so conveniently in the same London neighborhood! Sorry, I don't feel sympathetic towards them. Morever, it's a bit of a male-bashing plot. A bad ending, in my opinion, negates what comes before it.I want my ten hours back!!!!;Book
"I really enjoyed reading ""The Girl on the Train"".  The characters were interesting to learn about and the story was very different.  I enjoyed seeing life through the eyes of the Rachel and the other main characters.  Rachel made me feel what she was feeling and I was interested to see what happens next.  The book was shocking, but thrilling to read.  I like that the author tells the story from more than one perspective, but the main focus is on Rachel. I got to understand her better as the book went on and you can't help but feel pity for her when you learn why she ended up a binge drinker.  I like the way she sees life through the window of the train.  I can relate to how she felt.  The book was a page turner from beginning to end and it was well written. I would recommend it because I enjoyed it and it was also a unique story.";Book
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is told from the first person point of view by Rachel, who imagines fantasy lives for people living in homes that she passes on the train. Living a restricted life, her daily train rides disguise that she has been fired from her job. As a heroine, Rachel is not particularly likeable. She has low self-esteem and is frequently so drunk that she has memory lapses, with one such lapse serving as a primary focal point.  Personally, the constant inebriation was overdone. Other characters, particularly the male ones, are similarly unlikeable. And when Rachel injects herself into the lives of those who had been fantasy characters, it's a bit much to accept. No doubt, this novel has become popular because of Ms. Hawkins' skill at slowly unraveling the many layers of this novel's central mystery: What happened to Megan?;Book
I ordered the book for a friend and took it out of the library for my self.  My friend loves mysterys.  I had a hard time getting trough it.  I don't know why it is on best seller lists.  I returned the book for her and another I ordered from Amazon called Headstrong.  She had a PHD in biochemistry.;Book
I'm usually not into thrillers. I lean more towards historical fiction but I couldn't put this one down! At first I bought just the Kindle version but I soon added the audio version for my car. It is very well-written. Even though several women are narrating at different times, it is easy to follow along and know who is speaking. This is especially important on the audio version. I was never confused about who was narrating. I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie (which is also good but in a different way).;Book
"I read the whole thing because it was my book club's monthly choice.  The first negative is that the names and characters were very confusing and difficult to keep track of who's who.  This clarified after the first several chapters.  The second negative is that I didn't like the main character at all.  She was such a wimp and complainer!  I don't like being around negative, complaining people, so reading a book full of ""poor me"" was not fun or entertaining.  I also figured out ""who done it"" rather quickly, so it wasn't much of a thriller.  The writing was average, so I didn't have to suffer through poor sentence structure or grammatical errors.  I wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than spending money on it.  I deleted it from my tablet immediately after the book club meeting.";Book
The book was recommended to me by a respected friend.I feel I should have downloaded the sample first.I found the author's style to be repetitious and confusing as the principle in the book started off by deceitful behaviour in order to conceal that she no longer was employed, but continued to a daily routine involving the train to and from her point of previous employment.She then continued her downward spiral through a series of actions involving what amounted to voyeurism, then alcohol dependency, to infidelity and finally involvement in a murder.This is not the kind of book that I would endorse.;Book
If you are looking for a page-turner of a mystery, this is for you.  The protagonist, Rachel, has plenty of problems- out of work, divorced and alcoholic- and she rides a train every day to keep up the appearance that she has a job for her room mate, Cathy.  She watches a couple she does not know every day but sees their happiness and longs to experience the happiness she once knew.  But then the woman she watches disappears after a night where she was drunk and in the area and she cannot remember what happened.  The list of suspects grows and you can not be sure what happened as the layers of the characters are peeled back, one by one.  This is an intense psychological thriller that will keep you turning the pages for more.;Book
"At this moment in time newbie authors are trying to jump on the bandwagon so they can get ""The Next Gone Girl"" blurb on their book cover. (While I loathed Gone Girl and wished every character to die die die, I would be a fool not to acknowledge the success of the book.)  Paula Hawkins' novel is the story of two hot messes and how their lives intersect even though technically they never meet. Well, lets be honest: everyone in this book is a hot mess and even after the climax of the story I believe they will continue on their individual downward spirals. But I was more entertained, was more interested in how everything would be resolved, and had a better time reading this Girl than I did That Which Shall Be Forgotten.";Book
"With all the hype 'The Girl on the Train' had been getting, I wasn't quite sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. Generally I tend to steer away from huge blockbuster books as they are a little more ""safe"" than what I usually enjoy reading. Lucky for me, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was sucked into this book from the very beginning. One of the best ""page-turner"" thrillers I've read in quite some time, 'The Girl on the Train' is a fantastic psychological work. Not only a thrilling read, but also a smart one that makes you question how much you might really know about someone - even after you think you know it all.";Book
"I read The Girl on the Train in one weekend after seeing a preview of the upcoming movie. It looked intriguing so I bought it. The character development is good but not too much to bore you and the story moves quickly. There are definitely some twists and turns as the plot is told through the perspectives of three different women, but I was able to figure out ""who done it"" about a third of the way into the book. That didn't completely ruin it for me because I still wanted to see how things would play out in the end. It's not serious reading but it is entertaining.";Book
I found this book tedious in the extreme.  Not fast-paced, not a thriller.  The characters weren't relatable, they were boring.  The alcoholism was grating, and far too repetitively convenient as a plot point.  I'm giving it two stars because the writing was decent -- not compelling, but Ms. Hawkins knows how to put sentences together and has a decent command of grammar, a skill not shared by a lot of current authors.  Her plotting is another matter. The overall plot wasn't bad, but along the lines of what another reviewer wrote, instead of putting the effort required into writing a truly engaging story with unfolding events, the author just had her narrators withhold detail so she could have a series of plot twists.  I knew who the killer was halfway through the book.  The final twist was the most satisfying, but it was an effort to finish the book to get to it.;Book
I've never wanted to bitch slap a story character so badly and i don't believe in violence.  I was rooting for Rachel but she was a hot mess.  Is it possible for a person to be that herp derp?  I cringed at her repeated socially awkward behavior and situations she put herself in.  Yes we have all been fools for love but Rachel groveled to new depths.  I am not familar with severe alcoholism but her constant blackouts became annoying.  I was hoping Rachel would adopt some real detective skills and her mission would inspire her to grow a spine but that never materialized.  The foundation of the story is enticing and I kept thinking any minute it was going to kick into overdrive, instead the book stayed in third grear grinding to a petered out finale.;Book
I got this book to satisfy my need for another Gone Girl –type of thriller to read with my mother this summer. This fit the bill.  I’m usually the type of person who can’t predict an ending in a mystery and I’m almost always surprised with where it goes. Not so with this book. The plot is not too complicated, so it’s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book. Prepare yourself for a main character that you will not like. This makes the story itself shine more than the main character, which is a very interesting. Also, the main idea of the story – witnessing something on a train and then inserting oneself into the drama is a great premise. Overall, a good book and a great summer read.;Book
"If you like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and other psychological thrillers in that genre, then you'll probably love The Girl on the Train. This is an excellent and superbly written book, amazing for a first novel.But I didn't particularly like Rear Window (more boring than suspenseful, I thought), and I found it a bit hard to get through this book for the same reasons. Despite excellent writing and a great story, it moved so glacially slowly that I got bored and disinterested. Personally I'm more a fan of action thrillers, and this just had too many long stretches of nothing.Still, it's a great book for those that like long-simmering suspense; so I rate it as 4 stars as a compromise between 5-star writing and 3-star interest for me.";Book
"I started reading this book on an airplane; LaGuardia to El Paso. I was 80 percent finished by the time I arrived in Texas. I could not put it down. I vaguely recall airline crew talking to me: In case ofemergency...do you want something to drink...etc. I, however, was not flying on a plane but was instead, riding in a train. Thank you for this addicting read.";Book
"Did not like this book. Best seller?  Felt kind of duped or suckered.  Found the pace dull, slow and many of the points repeated over and over.  Not really suspenseful, with an end set of events that held no surprise.  Reading a book were I do not like any of the characters and find their motivations so shallow and petty is not fun, enlightening or a good read.  Don't get me wrong, characters need flaws and personality complexity to bring a story to life.  But to paraphrase Dean Wormser ""Son, fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life.""  It does not make a good main character either.";Book
"This book reminded me of the classic ""Rebecca"" with the irreliable narration and tormented protagonist, except honestly this story was a bit more of a page turner, but this is mostly due to a style of writing more suited to a modern audience.If you are someone who has suffered abuse or suffer depression, this book is likely to be a trigger and may have a bad effect on you. Most reviewers don't think of such things.This was a very good book and I highly recommend it, I'm not one to go on analyzing a book. Let just say it will have an emotion impact on you. If you like your protagonists to be loveable and larger than life, you won't like this book, it is dark and perhaps just a little to ""real."" I see it compared to ""Gone Girl, and I get the similarity, this one requires much less suspension of disbelief.";Book
The previous reviewers who remarked that the voices of the three narrators/women were wholly interchangeable hit the proverbial nail on the head! That and the fact that there was no real nuance or dimension to any of the characters to begin with are the biggest disappointments about this novel. Maybe the latter is the reason there were no real distinguishing features between any of them other than their circumstances so it is really the same problem. And the characters were not believable or likable. I did, however, from time to time find myself rooting for Rachel despite her propensity for excessive apologizing and her pathetic behavior and life, and I found the story/plot itself was still a relatively engaging whodunit so I gave it three stars overall. Just don't expect it to move you in any way.  Profound this novel is not.;Book
"This was one of those books that is hard to review. All of the characters were horrible people, not a likable person in the bunch. But yet there were times I could not put it down, wondering what would  happen next.  Would I recommend it?  I'm not sure. It was different, but somewhat akin to Gone Girl. If you read that book, you will know what I mean about unlikable characters. A bit of a ""train wreck"" pun intended, several bad marriages, a drunk you just want to slap sometimes, mental abuse, it's got all that! If you like dysfunctional people, this book might just be for you.";Book
Great suspense story, slightly better than the movie.  It is now a movie which I found a little confusing on the characters.  I believe the book helps clarify the ambigusness.;Book
Yet another version of an inexplicably popular genre: poorly written books about awful people who do awful things to each other because they're too shallow and too bored to think of anything better to do with their time. Girl on the Train, Gold Finch, Gone Girl, Go Set a Watchman. Why do all these train wrecks start with the letter G? Not because they're good or worth your time to read. Why these books are sometimes grouped with Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is beyond me, since Doerr always writes beautifully about worthwhile people and subjects. Kindle keeps recommending books like this for me, I guess because I keep reading them. Addicting, like the booze their protagonists often over consume. No worries, though. Tomorrow I'm going to quit.;Book
I enjoyed this book because it brought to mind things I've thought about while looking out of a train window while going to school overseas for two years.  The route was the same twice daily so I saw the same buildings and  people and wondered about their lives.  It's the same  familiarity with a neighborhood you get if you walk a dog along the same path.  You start to make assumptions about the people you see, imagine their life stories,weave scenarios in your mind, and then find out the rich people in the mansion can't afford furniture, the slender woman is bulimic, and the pleasant man kicks his dog.  This is a really good premise for a story.  I wish I hadn't realized quite early who would actually have done what, but I've read a lot of mysteries.  This book had believable and interesting characters. It was all in all a very good read.;Book
I loved this book and read it in about 3 days.  I thought the characters were compelling, albeit self-absorbed and difficult to like at times. I was drawn in by the first few paragraphs and how sad and dejected Rachel was, but I kept going because I really wanted to figure out what happened to Megan and to see if Rachel finds some peace.  The only flaw with this novel, in my opinion, is the 3 main characters' preoccupation with husbands, babies, and reproduction.  All of their lives, and personalities, revolve around men and babies, and they all seemed in competition with each other over who has the most idyllic family life.  It struck me as an archaic, artificial basis for their actions, which gave the whole novel an almost sexist feel to it.  Having said that, the novel is entertaining and seductive and I would definitely recommend it.;Book
The Girl on the trainI was a little confused at the beginning of this intriguing story, but once I was able to identify each individual character the way the author had intended to portray them I was on a roll.As the story begins to unfold and the secrets,  lies and deceptions come to light through this well written storyline it became impossible to put the book down.I was totally captured in the whole thrilling,  captivating suspense, the twists turns right to the very end, and once you begin to understand each individual character you will then be totally hooked as the story unfolds and the killer is revealed.Definitely worth the read.Loved it Paula, nice work.;Book
"You NEED to read this before the movie comes out.  The pace is steady; page after page the story develops until you get to the top and realize that what you thought about a character was completely off.  Truly well written.  I'm a suspense kind of gal, so I'm a fan of Paula Hawkins.  I'm looking forward to the movie yet still always believe that the books are better than the movies.  You cannot capture thoughts, emotions, and scenes in movies as well as you can within your own imagination.  I will not give details into the plot.  You must simply read it.";Book
"So glad these women didn't continue as pathetic victims. The unfolding of truth was well done. Anna was triumphant mad creepy at same time. She might be the character I would most likely to see if cashed in movie. Megan was so well scripted out... Sounded borderline personality or bipolar. Well done. The doctor ... Story of her past had so much potential for a thriller in itself. Great characters ... Lushes, cheats, narcissists. I didn't feel sorry for people too long which was a nice reprieve. Everyone was good and evil; except baby. Not sure if murderer was anything but a pathological liar gone socio path. Not a lot of good underneath it all. Liked it very much. Will miss no one though. Never want to see anyone again because it would be a nightmare that you would want to wake up from. Scary women.  Scary men. Evie has a legacy now.";Book
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read.";Book
This book is so easy to read that before I knew it I had read for hours!! I wanted to gobble it down as fast as I could. The main character is an emotional mess and it can feel depressing in places, but keep reading! Written as stream of consciousness, you learn plenty about the characters consistently throughout the book.  There is a lot to know and the story opens like a rose, revealing the confusion, tension and mystery of the plot. It keeps you guessing who the victim will be, and then who the murderer is! Terrific ending!!;Book
"I loved this book from start to finish.  And I also loved how it was written - in the ""First Person"", but by three different people, but also each narrator follows a slightly different timeline.  The main narrator is Rachel with Megan also narrating a good part of the book and finally Anna who plays just a minor role in the narration.  Megan's story is a few weeks behind Rachel's.The story is excellent with a great twist at the end.  It is very well written and the characters, who you get to know in a very gradual way, are very believable.  The story, and writing style, gripped me from the very beginning and kept my interest right up to the end.If this is Paula Hawkins' first book then I cannot wait for her second one.";Book
The story was told in somewhat confusing narration. It was very hard to care for the main character and about three quarters into the plot, it was clear who was the killer. It was very hard to care for the people, they seem flat and one dimensional. The writing was OK, but lacked the ability to grab your attention fully as it was jumping from person to person with no seeming connection and the story felt like it was not developed with neither.;Book
I could not put this book down once I started. (I read it in a few days -- that's how good it is!) It is full of twists and turns. I love that each chapter is narrated by a different character. It was a bit of an easy read for me but still kept me on the edge of my seat. Every chapter I would change my mind on who I thought the killer was.I would definitely recommend to those that love a good thriller. Can't wait for the movie!;Book
"It's no ""War and Peace"" but The Girl on the Train was perfect for me to read on a long trip.  The plot offers some insight on how much anyone can really know about another person, especially if there are drugs and alcohol involved.  The heroine, who is battling her own demons, observes certain behaviours and comes to conclusions about them.  The truth is not always as simple as it seems, however, and jumping to conclusions without knowing the whole story is never a good idea.  The book is about how she finally makes sense of nonsense.";Book
"I really wanted to love this book.  The premise was so intriguing....girl riding on the train inventing lives for the occupants of the houses she passes every day.  As the story unfolds about the girl on the trains past relationship with these houses I felt a little set up.  Some of the twists were true twists and the identity of the ""bad guy"" was initially surprising.  If this book had ended differently I would have had a better reading experience but it stepped into a very unbelievable set of behaviors that sapped the energy from the book.  The Girl on the Trains character was not as developed as it could have been.  I did enjoy the different voices the story was told from as we got to know more about the characters.";Book
I don't understand how this could be compared to Gone Girl.  ALL of the characters were unlikable, the story dragged on, and the ending was predictable. Don't waste your time. I gave it two stars only because I actually finished the book.;Book
This was highly touted and I did like it, listening to the Audible version on my morning walks. It was well narrated. At first it was hard to care about this young woman who had totally lost her sense of self respect and was basically a desperate drunk. But as the story unfolded and she observes a couple in the house down the street from where she used to live, she fantasizes about their life as she fakes going to work on the train to the city. She is living with a friend since her husband left her but doesn't want her to know she has lost her job.I was involved in the characters and felt sorry for this pathetic woman who can't seem to face reality and get her life together. I would recommend book. It does twist toward the end.;Book
"The main character constantly enters into situations with no plan about what she is going to say or do.  It was very tiring reading over and over again, ""I know I shouldn't do this, but...."" and off she goes.  It was sad reading about someone with no self esteem and always so drunk she couldn't remember what she had done.";Book
It's hard to argue with the success of this book--millions of copies sold in several languages, a movie deal, and almost 44K Amazon reviews, so far. The story kept me hooked, and the author's storytelling was fresh and original, with characters whose personalities were revealed a layer at a time. I will say the pacing dragged a bit in the beginning, but once the story got going, I continued to read until the end. I felt empathy for the flawed protagonist, Rachel, who has been beaten down by life and finds it hard to cope. Not everyone finds life easy to navigate, and I rooted for Rachel to the last page.;Book
"This story of The Girl on the Train is on suspenseful and adventurous ride. Turning this way, then that way; Hills and valleys. You think you have the perfect glimpse of a suspect only to be thwarted by another dark tunnel or turn. The perfect mystery.";Book
"If Eric Bentley was right, and melodrama is fueled by the amount of fear it generates, then this is a successful melodrama. These women are all but literally tied to the train tracks in their shared London neighborhood. Their relationships are sharply rendered but shallow; there is betrayal, hand-wringing, abandonment, posturing villainy, and pathological obsession with all things superficial--body shape, real estate, reproductive success, chemical vice, and sexual virtue. Infidelity and sexual adventurism remain punishable by death (for women only). This story's twists and characterizations are so broad and archetypical that it could be told in pantomime. Luckily for us, it's told in really excellent prose; Paula Hawkins has a lot of fun with this problematic potboiler, and so did I.";Book
"Many have compared this novel favorably to ""Gone Girl"" and I can see why - both share an unreliable narration (three narrators in total) and unreliable spouses, too. Key details are effortlessly omitted until they play a major role in the ending (e.g., certain facts that were never explained turn out to be very important). While the novel starts a bit slowly, the second half moves along much better as the story is tighter and increasingly suspenseful.Hawkins' writing is terrific - almost cinematic - and her portrayal of the sad alcoholic Rachel Watson is, as Stephen King tweeted, ""dead perfect.""A recommended read.";Book
"I had previously read ""Gone Girl"" as a book recommended to me by a friend.  Liked the book but didn't think it was anything ""great"".  The Girl On the Train is great!!  Admittedly, I can be a bit of a snob when it comes to books.  I have ""divorced"" more than one book before reading even twenty pages - live is too short and there are too many truly good books to read.  An interesting and unpredictable plot is no longer enough to satisfy me as a reader.  I need smart writing and, frankly, a vocabulary that challenges me without being tedious.  The Girl On the Train is all of that and more - suspenseful with a unique storyline and human.  I have given it my highest endorsement - recommending it to my friends.  Waiting to hear more from you, Paula Hawkins.";Book
I purchased this book for a book club I joined and needless to say I finished it before the set date we were to discuss it. This story kept my attention from beginning to end. I loved how the story is told from the three women perspectives so you gain a full understanding of how they are connected. For a while I had a couple people in mind as the murders when I got closer to the end and realized neither of the people I suspected to be the murderer I was quite surprised. I read a couple reviews stating that they expected the story to end the way it did but I beg to differ. I didn't feel like this was a typical story of love and betrayal. If you do decide to read this book I honestly don't think you will be disappointed because I certainly wasn't.;Book
I read this right on the heels of another multiple-perspective suspense novel.  While the first one felt very flat, this story seemed to pop to life from the very beginning, and while the characters in the other book were boring, these were interesting.  Just when you think you knew something about them, they were still able to pull off a surprise or two.  While the overall tone is not comedic, there were occasional moments that made me laugh out loud.  I enjoyed getting into their minds.  The other thing I enjoyed about this book is that I could really visualize very vividly what was going on, and I kept feeling like this could easily be adapted as a film.  I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins!;Book
The story compelled me into reading at any interval I could justify so that I could get to the end.  It dragged for me in the very beginning with the extensive description of Rachel's alcoholic behaviors.  It did set it up well, however, for the way through the rest of the story.It is a good psycho-thriller.;Book
At first I found the book a bit difficult to follow because it jumped from character to character and dates kept changing with the change of characters. I quickly realized I had to pay attention to which character and what the date was when going to a new chapter.  But I found the book intriguing from the first page. I couldn't put it down. Well written - - a great mystery.;Book
I started reading this book a few years back and I left it on the 3 or 4th chapter. When I saw that they made a movie of it. I decided to give it another try. I immediately remembered why I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to unveil the secret and get to the bottom of everything. The book leads you one way and then it takes you another. Buy what I found most profound is the description of alcoholism and what people really go through. I really felt dizzy and frustrated and angry and Rachel at times. It was a very good book and I can't wait for the movie!;Book
This is just not my kind of book.  I prefer they Clancy type books. However with ll the hope and the new movie I thought. I would raid it.  A long story abut crazy chicks is not for me.  I figured our who killed Megan about mid-way though the book.  It droned on and on until the last few chapters.;Book
At first this book was confusing as could be.  I finally figured out that the author is jumping from two different characters - both written in First Person.  Then I re-started the book.  And as it progressed, a third character was also added - written in First Person.It is a great story - had me guessing right up to the very end.;Book
"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shocked—and feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problem—well, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectives—Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career.";Book
Truly, one of the worst books I've read in years. Though it tries to be suspenseful, it is simply chaotic – yet fashionably predictable. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure the film will be different, but I simply cannot recommend this book. It took a lot of will to finish it.;Book
This is what you call a true novel. I loved the way the writer took time to build up the scenes. The writer also used the pen with the plot to make you think as well as talking about more in each scene. The writer makes you feel like you are in the scene and in the mind of the character.;Book
I got 60% of the way through the book and had to look up the ending on Wikipedia because I couldn't read anymore. The characters are incredibly unlikeable. Rachel, the main narrator makes terrible dicisions again and again even though she is fully aware that they terrible. 90% of what I read was Rachel being drunk when she was trying to be sober and harassing people.;Book
Well written novel about a neighborhood in the London suburbs near a train where a murder takes place, and how the murderer is in plain sight, but not discovered until the end of the story.  The story is told from 3 different women's perspectives, even the one who is eventually murdered.;Book
"The early reviews were right. Pick this thriller up and be prepared to plunge into its world of overlapping characters, well-placed red herrings and enough female angst to fill a shrink's office. Paula Hawkins' complex thriller is the book ""Gone Girl"" wanted to be but wasn't. (Sorry  ""Gone Girl"" fans.) Its heroine's alcohol addiction fuels her obsession with a house she passes daily on a train commute to London. Hawkins never quite lets us know if someone is heading for harm or salvation, and the imbalance is thrilling. Divided among three female characters, the chapters take the reader to the edge of one of two things - a purging reality or the embrace of unspeakable danger. Un-put-downable.";Book
"A real ""who done it"" story. The author draws you into each of the woman's lives then twist and turns them around. Not sure who is responsible for the outcome of the story, all lives interact with one another. Because this happened then this happens but wait.... Because what was witnessed while on the train rolling past..... All intertwined. This is a very good murder mystery book.I probably should give this a five star but I hated the gruesome ending. It was the right ending....I just don't like violence.  I usually stay away from murder mysteries but it was our book club pick for the month. I am glad we picked it.I don't think I will ever get drunk ( not that I ever have but I will never contemplate it now) after reading this one!";Book
Took me about a day of reading to get through, and not that i expected the ending exactly  just due to the cues not being very present but i knew something big was going to shift. I feel like the book should have been two in a series because the cast completely shifted in the last chapters.I will say that it was evoking how accurate Rachel's narriations on alcoholism were.Won't be reading again but probably will go see the movie soon, but not on opening weekend to avoid the seburban housewives who read this in their book club.;Book
Every book today is compared to Gone Girl. Its the New Gone Girl,the Newer Gone Girl,  the Newest Gone Girl. So for those of you expecting a Gone Girl Repeat, this book will disappoint you.  I for one did not love Gone Girl.  However, as The Girl on the Train has amassed 10,000 plus reviews on Amazon, it has just as much hype as Gone Girl.  Train's premise is fun especially for those of us who enjoy peering in people's houses  and lives unobserved from the window of a train or car but  the execution is amateur. Still it is a compelling read.  Rachel is a fun character, a total loser who has kind of accepted her rejected, drunken status and doesn't seem to get to rattled about anything.  Won't take too much figuring out to guess who the killer is in this book but all the same, its a pleasant way to pass a few hours.;Book
While this was a  most interesting and entertaining book, and It occupied my thoughts when I put it down, I find I can not give it the four or five stars it would otherwise get from me because the voices of the three main women were too similar. I often had to refer to the name at the beginning of the chapter to see who it was about, or read deeply enough into the story to get the gist. There were no individual telltale words or patterns of expression to tell which one the chapter was supposedly written by. Voice is the only major problem I see.;Book
"There's a good reason this is coming out in movie format.  It's GREAT!  Kind of made me feel engrossed in the same way ""Gone Girl"" did.  I had to keep checking the time line to keep things straight in my head.  I'll be interested to see how the movie works with that.  Let your imagination take you through the visuals your mind creates before watching Emily Blunt create a whole different picture.  I'm sure the buzz about the movie is right and this will be a winner.  How could it not be with that woman acting the starring role in a story this dark?";Book
I love to read a book before hi see a movie when I can.  You know the book is always better, but I actually look forward to the changes.  Seeing how they pictured the characters compared to me.I think it took a little while for the book to pick up and for me to get use to the back and forth between characters, but by the end I was looking forward to the end of one person's point of view so I could read the others and compare.I like that I didn't put it all together early on.  I was surprised when I knew who did it.;Book
I read this book in a couple of days and enjoyed it.  I thought it was well written and I liked how each chapter was from a different character's point of view.  None of the characters were that likable, but then, who is?  :)But seriously, the main character was weak and did some pretty foolish things.  However, this made her interesting and you never knew what she was going to do next.  I do wish that she'd ended up being stronger after all she'd gone through, but she was still running away from things and afraid in the end.  I'd recommend this book as a fun, suspenseful and easy read.;Book
Ugh. This book reminded me so much of Gone Girl. I think I'm one of the only people I know that hasn't liked either. Both of them I did finish because I wanted to know how they ended. This book was a little more satisfying at the end, but not by much. I found myself not LIKING any of the characters. I couldn't pull for anyone, because they were all so unlikable. In the beginning, the main character makes up stories about strangers she sees regularly. Who with an imagination hasn't done that? After that, the story becomes rather far fetched. If you're bored and need something to read because you've read all the books by your favorite authors, then try this. Otherwise, there are many better bets out there. I just finished What She Left Behind. Loved that!;Book
Sure the plot devices of this novel are a little silly and far-fetched. Sure the main character gets asked to specific locations because the story requires it in order for the plot to continue. Sure the ending deserves a couple of eye-rolls.But who cares? The central mystery of the novel is compelling enough to make you HAVE to know how it ends. I read the entire book in a day and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read FOR FUN.Haters gonna hate, but this book has more mystery and suspense that 99% of basically everything else.;Book
"This is a really interesting and well-written novel.It portrays a troubled alcoholic woman whose booze-induced actions and resulting amnesia are manipulated by other characters. The story centers around the disappearance of a young woman and the interaction among the protagonist, her ex and his wife, and the down-the-street neighbors. Much of the story occurs on the street adjacent to the rail tracks viewed from a train that the ""girl"" frequently travels.The carefully-timed character development perfectly allows the story to unfold and the suspense to build. The story is told from several characters' perspective adding to the plot and the personalities. The author's detailed picture of the personalities and the telling of the story my several main characters sets apart this murder mystery from most others.";Book
"This book is absolutely riveting. It is one of the best mysteries I have read in a long time. The writing drew me in from the very first page and I could hardly put the book down after that. Anyone who likes books by Tess Gerritsen will love this book. I liked the character of Rachel, even though she could be so exasperating. While the other characters were a bit less likeable, I could emphasize with them. The ending was a surprise to me, which was nice. I don't like to figure out "" who dunnit"" halfway through the book. I cannot speak to the comparison to Gone Girl. I saw the movie and thought it was just awful, so I never read the book. I highly recommend The Girl on the Train, and do look forward to the movie.";Book
"There are 5 main characters in the story and in each chapter, one of them is telling the events through their eyes - and so you have to remember the names and the dates are not consecutive, but jump back and then move to the present in the next chapter - her style of writing is a bit challenging; however, as the mystery unwinds, the suspenseful mystery builds and it gets harder and harder to put down.  The story starts out from the perspective of the girl on the train, who looks through the window and on the porch, watching glimpses of this couple, as the train makes a daily stop across from their house.  The story picks up the pace and pretty soon you will not be able to put it down.  There were a few graphical errors which made me go back and reread a few sentences, but it didn't detract from the story.  A great ride.";Book
At first I wasn't sure I'd like the book, as it started quite slowly and almost burdensome at times. But I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did! As the author gave us more details about each character, she started weaving the web that eventually trapped me and I was hopelessly and deliciously entangled. As she fed more and more details, the story took many right and left turns, and each time I thought I'd solved the mystery another detail was leaked and I found I was completely wrong. I could not help but finish the shocking climax in one sitting, each event unfolding at just the right place, finishing with the most unlikely heroine saving the day. Get and read this book - and be prepared for good ride. All aboard!;Book
"I had anticipated a bit more writing talent, this was an okay story, one good enough to not put down without finishing but, on the other hand, had I lost it or not finished it I would not have cared.Made out to be much more suspenseful than I found it to be and the details a bit outlandish, like trying to fit jigsaw puzzle pieces into a puzzle where they truly don't fit and say "" there, that's good enough"".Read it if there's nothing better around but I would not pay for it.  Just okay.";Book
This book starts to engage you from the beginning.  I had not read the book when it first came out, but thought I should when I became aware that a movie was being made with one of my favorite actresses, Emily Blunt.  I enjoyed the pity, irritation, and fondness I had for the main character.  Sometimes she was hard to like, but the author kept me stringing along.  I won't write more because I hate when someone writes a spoiler.  If you haven't yet read this book read it now it is truly a great story that is well written in a great style!;Book
At first, it was difficult to get into the story. A bit confusing and a lot of back and forth between characters and dates. Fortunately, for me, there were only three character's point of view. I finished the book in three days. The first day was arduous, but once I started again, the second day, it was almost challenging to put the book down. Finally, on the third day, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprising twist at the end and at times I suspected it could be..., but then thwarted the idea of it being so. Definitely a great, suspenseful read.;Book
"Much hype about this book.  The interaction of all the characters was improbable. While it is fiction and a snapshot of a time in space, none of the characters were particularly likable or realistic.  Hard to find much empathy for or identification with any of them. I know alcoholics with some of the devastating results experienced by Rachel.  Not sure people ""recover"" their memory or black-outs as quickly and clearly as Rachel.  But it would be a very long book if in the real world. The two babies in the book, one living, one deceased, were the ones for whom I felt anything except vague annoyance.  Imagine attempting to navigate such a self-absorbed adult world.  While the book moved quickly, ultimately I was disappointed.";Book
"""The Girl on the Train"" is a voyeuristic, cleverly plotted thrill ride.  Paula Hawkins is a first-time novelist.  She's a writer and editor by profession though, so 'Train' is no flying blind leap into a new career.  The writing and plotting here is ingenious and first rate.Were someone to tell you about the literary device employed here --- three first-person voices, alternating by paragraph, over different time periods -- you might think, jeez, that sounds hard to follow.  It's not. You pick up on it right away and get immediately into the flow.You can almost see the cinema version of the book in your mind's eye as you blitz through it.  So, no surprise then to read that Dreamworks preemptively acquired the rights to Hawkins' work late last year.";Book
"I was so disappointed in this book.  The characters were sad to read about and the plot line was horrible.  I would not call this a ""thriller.""  It was more a sad commentary about self destructive behavior.";Book
"I usually don't read these kinds of books, I think mostly meant for women.  But, once I got into the story and the twists and turns, I could not put it down.  I too wondered all along who the culprit might have been, and was somewhat surprised when I learned it all near the end of the book.  Although an interesting presentation, the chapters for a particular character need not have been identified as ""Morning"", ""Noon"" and ""Night"".  Somewhat different for sure, but a little irritating that was not necessary for the reader.  Excellent description of the neighborhoods outside London, and the train service which is also very good.  I have used it myself, on a holiday.  Easy to get around for sure.  So keep up the good writing and let us see what's out there soon.";Book
yuck!  I just disliked this book so much.  it seemed like a real take-off of 'gone girl' in some places and at times it felt as if some of the episodes were lifted directly from that book.  at any rate, I did finish it but am now looking to give it away to anyone I can since I don't plan on making it part of my permanent library.;Book
This book was recommended to me by a friend.  It's not the type of book that I normally choose.  When I first started reading, I wasn't quite sure that I was going to like it.  Rachel, the main character, was somewhat annoying to me (and this feeling lasting throughout most of the book).  It was also a little confusing switching back and forth between characters.  However, after a few chapters, I was hooked.  The author had a way of describing the characters that made you feel like you knew them.  Although it did take me a little while to really get into the story, before long it was hard to put down.  It is very suspenseful.;Book
"Its a good read; it pulls you in, never boring. Hawkins' use of multiple narrators helps the story flow well.  It is a dark story. The characters are each unlikable, some less than others, like Rachel, the main character. She is the only one in the book I could feel for.  I can't quite understand why some characters were the way the were, like Detective Riley. I guess my imagination will fill in the gaps there. There is a turning point in which the book becomes a bit predictable, but I can't say when as not to give away any spoilers.";Book
"I was hopeful with this book but truthfully was not very impressed.  While it had alternating persons telling the story, it jumped around too much at first in my honest opinion.  I knew it would ultimately come together at the end, but I found myself questioning whether the author was trying to be ""sophisticated"" and it was a little unnecessary, because not only did they describe a certain date but also whether it was the morning or evening.  That could've easily been determined if it wasn't broken up into sub-categories but just mentioned in the writing.  I also didn't find too much depth in the characters.  It was clear one of the handful of characters was the guilty party and it wasn't difficult to figure out by process of elimination.  It was a little disappointing. Just my 2c.";Book
This book takes hold of you from the very first page and never lets go.  You get involved with the characters,  the plot, and all the twists and turns.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Hope Hollywood does it good.;Book
I like that the killer is totally someone different than you'd expect and that it is written from three perspectives. Would definitely recommend hardcover or paperback rather than kindle as the dates bounce around. It was a little hard to read about the constant drunkenness and alcoholism, and this made it a little frustrating in the first half from Rachel's perspective, because all I could think was get it together! But as someone who is trying to understand the disease of alcoholism and addiction for a family member in my own life it was helpful to sort of see their struggles, self-loathing, and first hand disease. It sets the book up brilliantly as to how/why the killer did what he did. Excited to discuss at book club.;Book
It took awhile for me to understand the narration.  Just who was this Megan person anyway?? It was trying to read about an alcoholic who would voice the right things to do yet she would always do that which would damage her.  She really had no life of her own and lived in the past, bothering her ex husband and his wife, acting as if she were commuting work daily to avoid criticism from her landlord/roommate, dreaming about those people she saw in her old neighborhood as she rode the train.It seems the rambling thoughts and actions would go on forever and without purpose.  Finally the fragmented thoughts and storyline started coming together and suspense began to build.  The last half was a good story but I did question myself for many pages as to why I was still reading this book.;Book
"Great read for my cross country flight, it's a page turner or Kindle tapper to be more accurate. I doubt much of the story or characters will stay with me for long except for the alcoholic Rachel. As with any mystery if you figure it out too early on the rest becomes tedious. For me that was the case with this book and then suspense turned into impatience. But on the other hand if I hadn't been able to somewhat figure it out on my own I would have felt it was an ""unfair"" mystery so all good in the end!";Book
"This book is a very good read.  I have been at the book store and near the shelves that house this book and heard a person giving their opinion of the book to others and they could not have been more wrong. Then turning to me and saying ""Don't waste your time it is not a good book.""  Not to give any spoilers but what they were commenting about was the writing and how it was a little ""All over"".  It is supposed to be written like that, from the point view of the main character who has some issues and needs to figure out what is real or not.  I really enjoyed this book and know several others who have too.";Book
"I was spellbound, could not wait to get to this book every day, but my balloon of excitement and admiration burst with the ending. It was as if the author could not think of a good ending, so decided:""Let me get this over with, I will just write anything to end this mystery"", and here we were stranded with a no good solution that did not hold water after all the excitement that we had built up.Inger Ross-Kristensen";Book
So many twists and turns.  So many screwed up personalities. I felt it was depressing from the get go.  The more I read the more the personalities become more screwy.  Not a feel good read.  More like pathetic lives getting more pathetic.;Book
Confusing ... took me 3 times to get through the beginning because of the way the author makes the name of each chapter a character's name and goes back and forth in time.  For this reason, I had to keep putting it down.  Then time lapsed and I had to start over.  Finally put it down again for a long time and decided just finish it already which I did quickly.  Picked up the last 40 pages so only an OK.;Book
"Good opening, entices the reader into the story.  The three person narratives at times became confusing, especially if the reader put down the book and did not read it straight through, since there certain similarities in the character's traits. The author made good use of an ordinary circumstance of daily train riding to bring home a lot of good points.  The train is a metaphor for the lives of the three women in varying stages of decision making; Rachel caught in between life and destruction, Anna craving to move and Meghan who actually does make a move. I found their stories so intertwined for a while I thought they might be one woman with three personalities. I found the ending justified and was glad the author indicated the forward movement of the remaining characters. A good, light summer read.";Book
After all the hype, I was expecting more mystery and drama........sort of a nail-biter. But it's not that kind of book. It's more about what goes on in several character's heads, especially the main woman. It was just okay.;Book
This is a page turner. I was completely engaged in the story and always in suspense. I loved how the writing alternated between characters and how you really get in their head and yet see what they think of the others! The alcoholism was accurately portrayed. So glad I did not watch the movie first as I wanted to create my own visuals and see if the director was able to bring it. Good movie but disappointing in regard to being true to the story and bringing the suspense. For one the setting takes place in the USA in the movie. Wtf? I wanted it to be in England! Too many things missing from the movie as well, but thats the way it is. Books are ALWAYS better! Great read. I recommended it to my friends and they were NOT disappointed!;Book
The book was well written: there weren't many cliche' bits and there wasnt too corny an ending.  It kept me up thinking and wanting to continue to read on, even as my eyes were shutting. Interesting twists and turns to keep us off guessing how things would work up to the end.  Definitely a youth or young adult read.;Book
I am in the minority that didn't love this book.  It was slow in places and the final twist fell flat for me.  I guessed the person about half way through and was disappointed to find out that I was right.  I did like the feeling of being the person on the train who is playing Nancy Drew to help solve the mystery, however the drunken blackouts became predictable and made me skim the pages a bit.  I enjoyed the writing, however I would not call this the next Gone Girl.  I do not think the writing quality or story telling is anywhere near that of Gillian Flynn.  I think if you are looking for a Flynn style psychological thriller, you should pick up Mud Vein or Marrow by Tarryn Fisher.  The Girl On The Train is not as dark and twisted as I was hoping it to be.;Book
I bought this book mainly because it had been #1 NYTimes best-seller.  Big mistake.  I regret the time I wasted reading it.The vast majority of the plot energy centers around the female protagonists triumphantly discovering, verifying, agonizing over, and obsessing over the infidelity of their husbands. There is not one word about any attempts to solve problems or make a better marriage. There is not one word about the good side of any marriage.. On the contrary,If this bleep is to be believed, the only propose of marriage is lose-lose to give e the wife cause to feel bigtime aggrieved.  If that were the case, women's best course would always be to avoid marriage altogetherThat said, Hawkins weaves  in a powerful and non-preachy.anti-alcohol subtext.  If this book saves one young woman from life-destroying ravages of drink, that would be terrific.  But a good read it is not.;Book
"Mixed emotions here.  I was really looking forward to this book, based on the reviews, liking this type of book, having lived in London, and rode the train numerous times.  Maybe my expectations were, therefore, too high.  I found it hard to ""root for"" anyone; even the main character was hard to feel for, as her difficulties were for the most part self inflicted.  You have to pay attention reading this book.  The chapters switch among the three main characters, which was easy enough to follow.  But what I missed at first is that they are not necessarily in chronological order.  So when I got to a new chapter and saw which character's perspective was being told, I had to read the date and then go back to the previous chapter and compare dates to see if I was going backwards in time.  Easy enough to figure out, but just something to keep track of.  I never got to the point of ""can't wait to pick it up and read some more"", although I was interested enough to finish it just to see what happened.  I thought the writing was well done.  Good book, not great.";Book
After first hearing Paula Hawkins on NPR last year, I knew I had to read this book myself.  The problem was that it was too far down on my TBR pile for me to get to it anytime in the near future.Last night, however, I finished it.  I couldn't stop with ten pages left! I had to know!  I wasn't suspect of the killer the whole length of the book, so kudos.  Thank you for writing a page turner. For me, it was never dull at all. I will just have an extra shot of espresso in my coffee now that I stayed up too late finishing this one.Highly recommended!;Book
"A good read.  I like books instead of movies, so this was one that I might've gone to ""see"" in the theatre...  (I know there's a movie now and am considering it.)  Loved the twists and turns and the ending.";Book
very nice book with a well written easy to read. a surprising events and you will not understand until you finish the book. every single corner of this novel contain a story. waiting to see the movie.;Book
I was disappointed given the large number of stars many readers gave this book. I think 3 neurotic characters is way too much for a story - I felt like I was bouncing back and forth among the storied women and none of them evolved into a substantive character.;Book
I found this book very difficult to get into at the start. I had to go back to the previous chapter to check dates, but once I realized what the author was doing, the story became more suspenseful. It starts with Rachel, a train commuter, imagining the life stories of the people she sees out the window of the train everyday as she passes. She is especially concerned with a couple that lives in a house in her old neighborhood. She believes their life to be perfect. But all that changes as the woman turns out to be missing and the story turns to reality. Now the author moves the story along as told by the three main characters viewing the same events from each characters point of view. It was very interesting and difficult to decide who had the correct view as each had their own previous experiences that colors their outlook and Rachel has a drinking problem with blackouts. Rachel complicates matters becoming involved in the reality mixing it with what she had imagined.Even though I had trouble getting started, I kept reading because of all the previous great reviews and was rewarded with a great and differently told mystery story.;Book
Let's get something straight, I finished this book in less than 24 hours. Couldn't put it down but mostly because I wanted to see if I was right...and I was. Writing-good, characters-good, storyline-good. But if you're a regular reader of thrillers then it's not difficult to figure out. All that being said, I'm glad I read it and I look forward to the movie in October.;Book
This book is often compared to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which was a much better book IMO. As I read this book I was often able to predict what would happen next, and the author's attempts to create suspense<U+200B> sometimes fell flat.;Book
I was surprised to see so many five star reviews for this book. About the only part I could agree with was that Rachel's character was indeed bleak. The plot was limited as a soap opera, and I felt there had to be more to Rachel as a human being than this sniveling, self-absorbed wimp completely dependent on others. All three women base their happiness on whether or not they are desired by men. Scenes of confrontation that could be have been filled with dramatic tension, such as the ending scenes with Rachel and Anna, or Rachel and Tom, ended up contrived and ho-hum. I wanted Rachel to discover something about herself or reach deep within for inner strength she didn't know she had. I like to be left with thought-provoking ideas at the end of a book. I didn't feel anything with Girl on the Train.;Book
Though the book, like a train, took a bit to get up to speed, I really liked where Paula went with this.  I found myself becoming attached to the 3 main characters and loved how their stories unfolded. The read is pretty simple, yet very enjoyable.;Book
I absolutely loved this book. I have heard it being compared to Gillian Flynn's works, and I guess I see a slight similarity, but Hawkins did a great job of setting her own tone & pace. It's painful reading from the main character's perspective sometimes because she is just so screwed up, but the book itself was a great read. Enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes, and only a tiny bit predictable on occasion.I have said this to everyone I've recommended it to: The main character's room mate is the unsung hero of the book. What she deals with... pffft. I don't think I know anyone who would tolerate their room mate to act the way the main character does.;Book
A very dark and depressing book. I only finished reading it because I wanted to find out who the murderer was. I didn't care for the chapters toggling between dates in time and characters. The three main female characters were hard to differentiate in personality as were the two male characters. Lastly, the book would have been much more enjoyable if a British vernacular was used. Were it not for the names of the towns and a few other words or phrases, one would think the setting was in Canada or the US.;Book
This novel is written exactly as a movie, particularly the doble ending, so you're actually reading a thriller you might as well watch in a theater.  The writing is compelling and keeps you reading until you realize this is just another story written by the numbers with a very predictable ending.  Female characters are minimally interesting and the men don't come through as real and the action and red herrings are very transparent. If you are a regular reader of thriller and mysteries, you'll guess this one before you're half way through.  I suggest wait for the film that is already made or buy a cheap used softcover.;Book
"I read this for my book club; otherwise I don't think I would have read this on my own. The book was too much of a downer for me. All the women's stories are pathetic and tawdry, and they seem clueless about how to improve their circumstances. I don't like reading woman as victim stories, and this one is no exception, even when two of them get past the hatred for each other and team up to expose a killer. The book is well written and the plot is suspenseful, but the ending is rather predictable. I didn't understand what all the hype was about and sorry to say, I still don't.";Book
I really enjoyed this novel.  There's already tons of in-depth reviews, so I'm not going to do that.  I will say that at the beginning I was saying to myself, well this is just odd.  But soon I was completely involved and didn't want to put it down.  After I finished, I needed to talk about it, it really stuck with me.  So I googled the title and found a fantastic spoiler discussion and that was a great debrief for me.  It was really great to see what everyone thought of different things.  Specifically, I was shocked when I read that some people knew whodunnit before half way.  I certainly did not identify the person, and only had a pretty good guess before the denouement.  I may read it again.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.;Book
"Good story, though a bit dark.  I actually detest books and movies that are too dark, but this one had a small element of perseverance that helped me swallow some of the dark parts.  All in all it was still very entertaining.  I had trouble putting it down, but some of the ""twists"" were fairly predictable.  I was so engrossed by the main character that I had to catch myself from thinking I had some of her same issues!  Some of the suspense was created by some slightly frustrating means (continually forgetting certain details, not realizing certain things about her past), but still made for a great book.  Not on my top 20 list, but I would still recommend it.  Plus, it's a fast read, so why not?";Book
I wanted to love this book. Unfortunately I guessed who the murderer was when the character was introduced by Meagan. Am I a super sleuth or even a third tier Nancy Drew, nope it's that obvious. I think for me the rush of recovered memories at the end was disingenuous. Also the loving odes to Rachel's various alcoholic drinks were beyond tedious. I don't know if it was intended by the author and I am displaying my ignorance of a literary device but the drinks were a well established character. There were parts that were smart and I would become engaged, but then we were back on train sipping a G&T.;Book
This was for book club and we were all in agreement - utterly forgettable beach read. As this book was compared to Gone Girl and Rear Window we went in with high hopes. Unfortunately, you have three unsympathetic, unlikeable women who are unreliable narrators with similar voices, and the two-dimensional dysfunctional men in their lives. I figured out the murderer about two-thirds of the way into the book. The ending is nothing short of unbelievable. The one thing the author does get right is that alcohol-driven black outs are not caused by the failure to remember, but the brain’s failure to transfer events from short term to long term memory. She then discards this fact when her plot’s stuck and she needs Rachel to remember something in order to end the story. A very disappointing read.;Book
What a miserable waste of time and money! There is virtually no story line--just the rambling, disconnected thoughts of some miserable soul. I quit reading a quarter of the way through--utterly boring. (And as an English major, I will read most anything, including the back of cereal boxes, most of which are more entertaining than The Girl on the Train.;Book
Up until the last 20 - 30 pages, I was all set to give this book 3 stars.  I thought it was well-written and kept my attention, however, I had a very difficult time with Rachel.  I don't have to like characters in a book, but I like to understand why they do the things they do ... so that I can at least have empathy for them if not sympathy.  But, in the end, I not only felt empathy for Rachel ... but sympathy as well ... and found myself really rooting for her.  I figure that's a pretty good book that can change my feelings about a main character so drastically.;Book
I was excited to read this book because Amazon suggested it was similar to Gone Girl. However except for the multiple point of view format, the book is not great.I had to force myself to continue reading through the poor writing. I believe a good author would use descriptive words, not generalization of moods and character based on brands.( there was a lot of name dropping, was the author beings sponsored by these companies?)The book was shallow, the characters were shallow and I felt uncomfortable with the way women were depicted as weak victims and men as testosterone driven neanderthals.I loved the premise of the book, which is the only thing that kept me reading through the events and characters that were not clever or interesting.;Book
"I read ""The Girl on the Train"" entirely on the train--actually the subway--and it's a great, light read for my commute (unlike Rachel, I don't drink on the train, but I do love to read to pass the time!). It was a compelling premise--woman thinks she might have been witness to a crime, but doesn't remember due to alcoholic blackouts--and definitely passed the time entertainingly, although it did get a little repetitious in the last third of the story. The use of shifting narrators was clever, but not quite clever enough to stop me from figuring out the true killer ages before the denouement!";Book
If you're looking for an easy, enjoyable read without too much depth, this book is for you.A decent novel by anyone's standards. Well written with the right amount of humor and wit. (British humor and language is always something I enjoy -- a break from the norm.)However, I don't see what all the rave is about. It's another Gone Girl in style and plot. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a page turner and I often found myself wanting to get back to reading as soon as possible. But, in the end, I just did not love this book.I guess with all the hype about how great of a novel this was, I got my hopes up. High expectations and average quality make for a semi-letdown reader.;Book
This is not my usual genre, but I am so glad I read it. Ms. Hawkins, you are phenomenal,####spoiler alert###I was so confused, I actually thought Rachel did it. I was like damn she was so angry about about Meg cheating on Scott she killed the B, and what the hell did Meg sleep with the psychiatrist??? And Anna, so vapid until the end then wham!! She is just as crazy as the rest of them and you realize the only same one is the drunk. The ending is not happy, not really. But its the only realistic way it could have ended.;Book
"This debut novel is told via three first-person narrators, all female, one of whom is the title character.  I found Rachel, the alcoholic title character, sufficiently complex and believable; though her excessive drinking makes her somewhat contemptible, it also makes her human, and I was able to empathize with her.  (Rachel's drinking is a necessary plot element, as it prevents her from remembering critical events.)  What makes this a less impressive novel than ""Gone Girl"" is the novel's narration.  One narrator is somehow able to recount for readers what is happening to her as she dies.  The mystery surrounding her death is, however, suspenseful enough to make the novel an interesting read.";Book
"I knew this story was not going to be pretty; after all, the main character is a pathetic drunk and a compulsive liar.  Every person in this sordid little drama has something to hide, and the book is written in such a way that the hidden parts don't fit together 'til the very end. The rotating viewpoints got to be tedious and confusing, especially since I wasn't able to read many chapters at one sitting. If you read this novel as an e-book, the repeated chapter headings with the same names will make it difficult to keep your place in the story line. I agree with many other reviewers; there was not a single character in this book that had any redeeming qualities. That said, I can't say I hated it; they all got exactly what they deserved from each other, as a bunch of scheming, selfish, violent liars.";Book
"Interesting plot twist though by the time the book got there I had figured it out.  This story starts out very slow, and I nearly stopped reading out of boredom and thought about deleting it.  However, I stuck with it and the last half of the story was much better than the beginning.  I wish the entire novel would have read as well as the last portion.  I wouldn't call this one a ""must read"" but it wasn't a waste of time either.  If you have time to read the entire story in one or two sittings, it's probably worthwhile.  Otherwise, I would pass on this one and look for something that flows better.";Book
"Having truly hated the book ""Gone Girl"", I can't stand the comparisons many make. Yes, they both are dark, twisted mysteries with unlikeable protagonists; but, while I found GG to be predictable and without any redemption, I found ""The Girl on the Train"" to be engrossing and at least somewhat redeemable. I've given it 3-stars only because I found it a bit hard to follow the characters at first and all the time jumps. I wish I had listened to it on audiobook (which I basically never say!) as I hear it was a really astounding book to listen to and more clear with the use of 3 distinct voices.";Book
Rachel, the girl on the train, has had a rough time of it.  She's definitely not where she thought she would be.  Rachel would ride the train to London every day for work, watching the houses as they passed.  One of the houses that she watched was the one that she use to share with her ex-husband.  Tom now shares that home with his former mistress, now his wife, and his infant daughter.  Four doors down, is a house just like hers use to be.  Rachel watches the couple in that house and creates an imaginary life for them in her mind.  She imagines their names, their love for each other, their life together.  Things are not as she imagines and as her drinking gets more and more out of hand, her bad decisions lead her down a dangerous path.;Book
"I am always drawn to stories told in first person and this book is a great one.  The story as it unfolds, is told by the three women in it.  These are real women---flawed but so human.  One has a problem with alcohol, one a problem with restlessness and fidelity and one has compromised for security and a ""dream"" life.  You will find yourself annoyed with them at times and at other times cheering for their small victories.  The story involves a disappearance of one of the women and how the other women and the men in their lives are all drawn into the mystery.  The plot is intriguing and clever the way it unfolds.  It builds to a great ending that ties everything and everyone together.  All questions come together and are answered.  I couldn't put the book down until I found out what happened!";Book
"I am reviewing this book in my husband's account as we share it and I am the one that purchased this book. I enjoyed the book overall and found it a quick and easy read. There were not many characters to follow which kept the ""mental effort"" a bit low at times and I found myself wishing the plot could have moved a bit more quickly. That's being said, I did enjoy the character development and final twist. I have loaned the book to several friends and everyone has enjoyed the read. I have read better books but many that are much worse!";Book
"I really enjoyed reading this book.  It kept my interest and I found myself looking for time to ""squeeze in"" a few more pages.  I actually finished itby reading late into the night under a ""sheet tent"" in bed so as not to wake my husband with the light from my Kindle. I did predict the ""bad guy"" early on, but I tend to do this with maddening accuracy on movies, books, or stories my friends relate to me.  The Girl On The Train did movingly portray the costly nature of alcoholism realistically from the alcoholic's viewpoint and her understanding of the frustration felt  by family, friends, and life bystanders.  All in all, an entertaining, easy read.";Book
"This was a pretty good book. It moved a little slowly at first, then picked up and had a slightly unpredictable twist. I say that because it was sort of expected but you were not so sure until your suspicions were confirmed. It was a good, relatively easy read and I would recommend it. It does provide an insight to the sort of darkness that envelops you when a vice takes you over. That aspect was the most interesting; being brought into the fictional world of an alcoholic and sufferer of depression was fascinating.";Book
I absolutely adored this book. I will not going into detail as to what happens, because I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, but this book will keep you on your toes. You almost feel creeped out at times by the rising in tension and switching points of views. It was a wonderful experience reading this book. I didn't expect the ending at all, which doesn't happen often! It's a book that gives you relief and sadness when it's over. I would (and have) definitely recommend to a friend, or anyone who likes psychological thrillers. 10/10.;Book
I read this book with high hopes as Gone Girl was really enjoyable. If you haven't read Gone Girl, this book would be a good read but I feel they had too many similarities. It was also a little slow and the female characters all seemed very weak and poorly developed. It does quite a bit of jumping from future to past which might make it hard to follow if you don't pay attention to the dates that the chapter has at each beginning.Overall not a terrible book, but like I said it seemed to similar to Gone Girl and the characters seemed a little flat for me with no real hook to keep my attention.;Book
The narrative style that alternates between three of the main characters is a clever and fascinating way to tell a story about love and marriage. The entire novel is an interesting commentary on the role played by memory, perception and observation and how little of it can be trusted.This is not a story for those seeking flawless heroines and heroic men. All of the characters are deeply flawed. The three main women - Rachel, Megan, Anna are compelling nonetheless. They make terrible mistakes and use incredibly poor judgement. Alcoholism, lying and cheating are not held up as excuses for their destructive behavior. Above all, they are human. The author brought all of these characters together in a skillful, although not totally unexpected way.Four stars because the end was a little too neat.;Book
"Although I have not read ""Gone Girl,"" the story contained within ""The Girl on the Train"" is very reminiscent of that story--thrilling, gripping, mysterious, unsettling. As soon as you wrap your mind around the world the author has developed, you will be hooked. As the characters begin to interact, the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways that will more than likely leave you reading this book within a minimum of 24 hours. I literally purchases this book last night before falling asleep, read it for 4 hours, woke up, read it for another 4 hours, and was blown away by its resolution. A must read for anyone who loves a story with a good twist.";Book
This one kept me turning the pages.  It presents you with a cast of characters who's lives have touched.  They are all woven together by the relentless imagination of one alcoholic and tragically lonely women, Rachel.  While you know that she has an active imagination you go right along with her as she attempts to make sense out of her rudderless life.  She manages to drag her ex-husband and his family into her drama and a couple that lives a few doors down as well.  Every day brings just a little more information to the light.  But what is true and what has her mind made up?  It is a page turner and when one of the characters goes missing it keeps you up at night trying to reach the conclusion.  A good one.  Well worth it.;Book
I bought this book just because it was on the best seller list without looking what it was about. I really like the premise about an alcoholic girl who witnessed things important to a murder investigation that no one believes. The book is told from three different women's point of view. The main thing I disliked about the book was the changing of perspectives that I felt weren't transitioned particularly well to form a seamless story early. Later on they started making a lot more sense, and were a lot smoother. All together it was a decent but slightly depressing with very few if any characters that are likable.;Book
"The Girl On The Train was a really great story!  The author has a way of making you relate to very unlikable and undesirable people.  It was suspenseful, the writing was good and I didn't find a lot of typos or issues while reading this book.  I saw other reviewers that were very negative and claimed that ""the author with-held important information and tricks you...""  And to that I say ""So when reading every book ever, you go in with full knowledge of everything that is happening to all of the characters automatically - Or do you read and learn more information as you go???""  This book was no different than any other suspenseful, mysterious, fictional book I've read.  It was Thoroughly enjoyable --- READ IT!!  You won't regret it!  ~Niki Noel";Book
I very much enjoyed this book...I was easily caught up in the downward spiral of the main character and found her both appealing and repulsive.  Some of her actions seemed uncharacteristic, but since I am not an alcoholic, I may not be the proper judge.  The writing is very good and the character development, though a little spotty for the ancillary characters, was pretty intense for the main character.  I subsequently saw the film and enjoyed it just as much.  It definitely was a benefit to have read the book.;Book
Every once in a while I read a contemporary book and wonder how in the world it made it to the best seller list.  This book is an example.  While the mystery itself is interesting, I have read many that are far, far better.  The chief problem is that all three of the female characters are similar, and the two male characters are nearly identical .  Furthermore, each character began to sound like the other.  It is the responsibility of the writer to have each of the characters speak differently--different rhythms, different word choices--all this helps the reader to differentiate who is who.  Now it is perhaps just possible that the author's intention was to say we are all alike, but I don't think the novel is that sophisticated. If you want a good train mystery, may I suggest Agatha Christie.;Book
What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren’t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, “How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.”The first person narrators don’t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it’s Rachel if she’s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn’t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn’t disappointed.;Book
It is popular and I was curious. It is interesting as a tour de force in the psychological genre, but I found it diffuse and a bit tedious. I never felt that I cared about any of the characters in the story. The journey I was being led on thus never really captured my imagination. To me, that is a significant failure in plot and character development. Perhaps, it is just not my type.;Book
Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : (;Book
When I first perused this book I was not impressed. But then last Wednesday came along and I had spent days preparing for a medical test and after that was done all I wanted was to get lost in a great book. Luckily I picked up The Girl on the Train again and was off and Running. A day later, I was done and completely satisfied with the talents of the author and wished I could hop into another one by her. Sadly, I have not found one yet. If you love to get lost in a powerful story with very well drawn characters and a stunningly artful plot with suspects galore except for the surprise ending, then be my guest. Buy your ticket today for a wonderful ride on the train of Hawkins Imagination and you too will take a trip via her talents which you will be grateful for.;Book
I found the story extremely boring. I quite before getting one third into the story as it seemed to just go on and on and on, and on, and I kept asking myself what is the point?  Finally, I realized I don't even care what the point is anymore. With nothing happening, I simply quit reading it.  The great reviews I don't get at all.;Book
From all that I'd heard and read about this book, it still wasn't quite what I expected. It moved slowly in the beginning and was kind of confusing. There were times when I went back and reread to keep the characters straight. It did pick up the pace in the middle and raced to the end, sort of like a train. I thought the characters could be developed more. You only know them superficially. When I finished the book, I still wanted to know more about them and their motives. Still it was a pretty good read and I was sort of surprised at the end.;Book
I would have given this 5 stars if it had been written in 3rd person and past tense.  There are 3 narrators and they all sound alike.  There is no difference in their thought patterns or modes of speech.  I think that writing in the 3rd person would have helped the author to make these characters ' voices more distinct.  As for writing in present tense, that's one of my pet peeves and probably won't bother anyone else.The plot, pacing and atmosphere are truly excellent.  I was kept guessing right up till the end, and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  I look forward to Paula Hawkins' next book with great anticipation!;Book
"This was definitely the best book I have read in a very long time!  From the very beginning, I was captivated by the characters and the suspense.  Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job of developing fascinating characters, and the plot is absolutely amazing, creative and suspenseful.  I had no idea ""who did it"" until very close to the end.  The writing is excellent, and I do hope she will continue to write books, and I will certainly follow her.  I read this book in only a couple days, because I simply could not put it down.  I could've read it even faster if I didn't have a few other things to do from time to time (like cook, clean, etc.)  I'm definitely looking forward to this author's next book.";Book
I really liked this book. I was skeptical that I would like it as much as I did, given how some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl, which I hated. There were some slow spots, and the main character's drunkenness got a bit tedious at times. However, the author did a great job building suspense. I was sure I knew the identity of the killer early on, but the twists and turns in the story made me realize my initial assumption was incorrect. Kudos for tricking me, even though I did figure it out before any of the characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>;Book
"I first read a small snippet of what this book was about from a magazine and it sounded so good,I couldn't wait to read it.I was a fan on Gone Girl and this definitely read similar to that I'd say. It was unexpected that so much of the story is inside the character's heads and really not much dialogue or your typical mystery/suspense book. It was a fast read that kept me interested, but once I figured out the ""twist"" I thought the ending fell a little flat for me. I was expecting/hoping for something more. None of the characters have any redeeming qualities and overall I felt like it was a lesson in ""the grass isn't always greener.."" type of thing. I read this book while on vacation and it was perfect for that.";Book
I haven't finished it yet but am 3/4 through.  Really like it... I listen to it in my car when driving.  Sometimes when I arrive at my destination, I sit in the car to listen more because I don't want to stop 'reading' it.  I thought it was a comedy and it is not...it is a murder mystery but a good book all the same.  Not real fond of the F word and some content was uncomfortable for me personally so that is why the 3 not because of the author but the content of infidelity, mental illness, alcoholism, etc.;Book
"I was personally recommended this book by a coworker and man am I glad that she recommended it! It is an amazing tale told from three different women's points of view. Rachel-a battered, alcoholic who was left by her husband for another takes the train everyday and imagines made up lives of people who live on the stops of the train. Megan-who suffers from guilt, anxiety and loss who tries to mask her pain in things she shouldn't. And Anna-a wife and mother who is trying to deal with her husband's ex all the while trying to be the perfect mother and beautiful wife. Their stories intertwine and lead up to a Saturday night when a great mystery happens. Filled with suspense, mystery, death and what real life throws at us ""The Girl on the Train"" is an excellent novel!!!";Book
This book was a bit too unbelievable even for fiction. It follows the lives of three women and their love intrests who all live on the same block and get to know each other through very contried circumstances. The characters were somewhat compelling but not very likeable.  I certainly wouldn't want to befriend any of the three main characters Rachael, Megan, or Anna. I found I could not identify or sympathize too much with any of them. The author switches between characters telling the storyline bouncing from each point of view.  The male counterparts were not nice guys. I found myself asking why I was reading a book about people I didn't like who did horrible things to each other and so many people involved in the plots. Just happy I don't live on that block.;Book
Over 5000 reviews so not much more to add here... But....Did I enjoy this book?  Yes.Is it a page turner?  Yes.Did I want to read this book when I wasn't?  Yes.  So got through it in a day and a half.  Nice way to spend a rainy weekend...Was it worth the Kindle price?  ($9.17 US) Yes.Did I learn something form this book? No.  With some books you walk away knowing that you have learned something about life or some aspect of life and in some ways, have grown from the experience.  But to be fair, while I did enjoy this book immensely, I am not a wiser/better person for it.SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTOk, if Megan never told anyone but her therapist about Libby (and he's not allowed to say) and Mac is dead, how did the media find out?;Book
I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did.  I'm a stickler for well drawn out characters, authentic dialogue and believable plots.  When I started this book it hooked me right from the get-go, which I love, and had me counting the hours until I could sit down and read some more.  I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Not a terribly involved and twisted plot line, but I love the unreliable narrator aspect of it, and this author clearly knows how to use that and make it work.;Book
I love mystery novels.  Twisted, simple or predictable, they appeal to my glass is half empty dark side.  But I also love depth in characters, which appeals to the psychologist in me.  The story is clever and twisted.  The idea of time and perspective as essential parts of the story is a good one.  Without the depth of character, the interruptions make the story seem somewhat more convoluted than clever and the characters more caricatures than complex.  An excellent first beginning with hopefully greater character development without the flighty time transitions to distract from the great use of language.;Book
Hated it. I couldn't read more than a few chapters. Boring;Book
This one is not real deep and leaves me feeling a bit sorry for so many pathetic yet relatable characters.  We've all met each of these personalities at some point. The multiple narrators format kept me reading and somewhat entertained waiting for the final twist. Good book to read on a plane or...a train.;Book
"i honestly don't get all the hoo-ha regarding this book...in fact, i found it so boring that i quit 2/3's in... i did skip to the end to see who ""done it"", but i had no empathy whatsoever for the protagonist, who is an unrepentant alcoholic and liar who makes life miserable for her long-suffering roommate as well as herself..don't bother with this book, there are so many better written ones with more interesting storylines and female protagonists.. such as the latest by karin slaughter...";Book
"While the writing style of going back and forth between characters - perhaps emulating the back and forth motions of the protagonist on the train, the writing itself felt redundant rather than allowing the story to progress. The ""who done it"" aspect of the story is well told and there is intrigue, but I question how this book rose to become a best seller.";Book
Interesting at first.  Became a bit tedious and unrealistic as it progressed.  Really-an ex wife walks off with your baby and no one calls the police and they continue to allow her to the house?  It just because. So implausible that it lost its entertainment value.  I also wasn't expecting it to be go dark and depressing.;Book
The book is well written and edited. No complaints there. But for the most part, it's painfully boring.  The entire story could be told in fifty pages, but the author takes three hundred before making it interesting.The main character is another issue. Pathetic and uninteresting. A loser from beginning to almost end. I would not recommend this book.;Book
Was I the only person who thought this book was terrible? Aside from being completely implausible (but not ridiculous enough to be entertaining or diabolical enough to be disturbing) the protagonist was annoying. I hate to describe a character so teenager like but there really isn't much of a redemption in her character or a better way to say it. She's self aware enough and self loathing enough that I couldn't relate or empathize. I struggled to finish this book.;Book
Very slow read.Too much repetition. Disappointed;Book
I don't think this book is worth all the hype.  Actually really a ridiculous story and rather NOT believable characters.  Disappointing read.  Was  what we read for a Book Club discussion and we were all disappointed.;Book
I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly.;Book
I saw this novel on the best seller list so I decided to read it. I cannot really judge it accurately because it is not my type of novel. The first few chapters were complex and slow but I stayed with it. As the pieces came together the story held my interest. The fact that I finished this book speaks for itself.  It is possible I should have given it four but for me it was not a rapid page turner.;Book
"I didn't like the ""first person"" writing style. I thought the book was overrated, and I couldn't wait until I finished it. I feel that it has a decent storyline, but it just didn't hold my interest.";Book
